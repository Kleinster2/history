# Phase 6 Plan: Geographic Depth & Institutional Application

## Context

The vault now has ~550 notes after 5 phases. The core thesis (institutions channel ambition into production or extraction) is well-developed for Western Europe, China, and colonial systems. However:

- **Geographic blind spots**: Scandinavia, Eastern Europe, Central Asia, Southeast Asia have minimal coverage
- **Thesis testing**: The "why institutions matter" argument needs application to regions with different trajectories
- **Modern gaps**: Financialization era (1980-2020) under-theorized
- **Orphans**: A few detailed notes (Diocletian) sit unconnected

## Phase 6: 30 Notes Across 6 Directions

---

### Direction A: Scandinavian Economic Development (5 notes)

## Summary

| Direction | Notes | Theme |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| A: Scandinavia | 5 | Cooperative capitalism |
| B: Eastern Europe | 5 | Extractive persistence |
| C: Southeast Asia | 5 | Late-industrialization paths |
| D: Financialization | 5 | Extraction vs. production |
| E: Information | 4 | Infrastructure constraints |
| F: Integration | 6 | Orphan rescue, weak links |

**Total: 30 new/updated notes**

## Why This Matters

Phase 6 tests the vault's thesis in new contexts:

- **Scandinavia**: Institutions can channel ambition cooperatively, not just competitively
- **Eastern Europe**: Extractive institutions persist through regime changes
- **Southeast Asia**: Late-comers can build institutions for growth
- **Financialization**: Modern financial institutions can become extractive
- **Information**: Infrastructure constraints shaped which institutions emerged

This strengthens the vault's argument that **institutions matter** by showing how the same principle operates across diverse settings—and where it breaks down.
