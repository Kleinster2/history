# Mughal India Economy

Mughal India was one of the world's largest and richest economies—producing perhaps a quarter of global GDP at its peak. Its cotton textiles clothed the world, its craftsmen were unrivaled, and its agricultural surplus supported magnificent courts. Yet this prosperity did not lead to industrialization. Instead, India became the victim of the first industrial revolution, its textile industry destroyed by British machine-made cloth. The Mughal economy is essential to understanding both pre-industrial prosperity and the Great Divergence.
