# Bank of Amsterdam

The Amsterdamsche Wisselbank (1609-1820) was Europe's first public bank of international significance—and a pioneering experiment in what we would now call fiat money. For 170 years it maintained near-perfect credibility, its "bank money" trading at a premium over coin. Then it collapsed, revealing that the 100% reserves it had promised were fiction. The Bank's history illuminates both the power and the limits of trust-based money.

## Overview

## The Problem It Solved

### Monetary Chaos (1600s)

| Problem | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Multiple coinages | Hundreds of coin types circulated |
| Clipping | Coins trimmed for metal |
| Debasement | Foreign coins often degraded |
| Uncertainty | Every payment required weighing, assessing |
| Transaction costs | High for large commerce |

### The Dutch Dilemma

Amsterdam was becoming Europe's trading hub, but its coin supply was a mess:
- Spanish, Portuguese, German, Italian coins all circulated
- Quality varied wildly
- Large payments risky and cumbersome

---

## How It Worked

### The Innovation

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Deposit | Merchants deposited coins |
| Assessment | Bank weighed, assayed for metal content |
| Credit | Account credited in standardized "bank guilders" |
| Transfer | Payments by book entry, not physical coin |
| Withdrawal | Could reclaim metal (in theory) |

### Bank Money (Banco)

| Concept | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| Bank guilder | Unit of account at the Bank |
| Current money | Actual circulating coins |
| Agio | Premium of bank money over coin |
| Typical agio | 4-5% (people paid extra for bank money) |

### Why It Commanded a Premium

| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Standardization | No need to assess each payment |
| Convenience | Book entries faster than moving metal |
| Safety | Metal stored securely |
| Trust | City guarantee |
| Network effects | Everyone used it, so everyone had to |

## The Official Model

### What the Bank Promised

| Principle | Claim |
|-----------|-------|
| Full reserves | Every bank guilder backed by metal |
| No lending | Just transfers, no credit creation |
| Withdrawal rights | Deposits always available |
| Transparency | Rules publicly known |

### Why People Believed It

| Evidence | Interpretation |
|----------|----------------|
| City backing | Amsterdam's reputation at stake |
| 170 years | Track record of reliability |
| Premium | Market validated trust |
| No failures | Unlike other banks |

## The Secret Reality

### What Actually Happened

| Official Story | Reality |
|----------------|---------|
| 100% reserves | Secret loans created shortfall |
| No lending | VOC and city borrowed heavily |
| Full backing | Gap between deposits and metal |
| Discovery | Fourth Anglo-Dutch War exposed truth |

### The Hidden Loans

| Borrower | Nature |
|----------|--------|
| VOC | Credit advances for Asia trade |
| City of Amsterdam | War finance, infrastructure |
| Duration | Decades before discovery |
| Knowledge | Top officials only |

### The Evolution

| Period | Practice |
|--------|----------|
| 1609-1650s | Conservative, near full reserves |
| 1650s-1680s | Some lending begins |
| 1680s-1780 | Significant gap develops |
| 1780s | Crisis reveals truth |

---

## The Collapse

### The Trigger

| Event | Date | Effect |
|-------|------|--------|
| Fourth Anglo-Dutch War | 1780-1784 | British attack Dutch shipping |
| VOC crisis | 1780s | Company can't repay loans |
| Withdrawal demands | 1782-83 | Depositors want metal |
| Revelation | 1790 | Reserve shortfall public |

### The Premium Evaporates

| Period | Agio (Premium) |
|--------|----------------|
| Normal (pre-1780) | +4 to 5% |
| 1783 | Falls toward zero |
| Late 1780s | Turns negative |
| Meaning | Trust destroyed |

### Timeline of Collapse

| Year | Event |
|------|-------|
| 1780 | War begins; stress builds |
| 1783 | Bank can't meet all withdrawals |
| 1790 | Agio collapses |
| 1795 | French invade; Republic ends |
| 1802 | City takes over administration |
| 1820 | Final liquidation |

## The Fiat Money Lesson

### What the BIS Paper (2023) Argues

Bolt, Frost, Shin, and Wierts analyze the Bank's failure through a modern lens:

| Finding | Implication |
|---------|-------------|
| Reputation isn't enough | Even 170 years of trust couldn't survive revelation |
| Backing matters | Unbacked claims eventually face redemption demands |
| Secrecy is fragile | Hidden insolvency works until it doesn't |
| Crisis triggers truth | External shocks expose internal weaknesses |

### The Core Tension

| Temptation | Constraint |
|------------|------------|
| Lend deposits for profit/war | Must maintain withdrawal capacity |
| Secret lending possible | Discovery destroys trust |
| Works in good times | Fails in crisis |

### Precedent for Modern Finance

| Bank of Amsterdam | Modern Parallel |
|-------------------|-----------------|
| 100% reserve claim | Capital adequacy claims |
| Secret lending | Off-balance sheet vehicles |
| VOC loans | "Too big to fail" lending |
| Agio collapse | Bank run dynamics |
| City bailout attempt | Government bailouts |

## Legacy

### What It Pioneered

| Innovation | Later Development |
|------------|-------------------|
| Public deposit bank | Central banks |
| Bank money | Fiat currency |
| Book-entry transfers | Modern payments |
| Reserve banking | Fractional reserve system |
| Credibility problem | Central bank independence debates |

### What Britain Learned

| Dutch Experience | British Application |
|------------------|---------------------|
| Bank of Amsterdam (1609) | Bank of England (1694) |
| Exchange bank model | Lending bank model |
| City guarantee | State charter |
| Bank money premium | Pound credibility |
| Collapse lessons | Bagehot's principles |

### The Deeper Point

The Bank of Amsterdam demonstrates both the power and fragility of trust-based money. For most of its history, "bank money" was better than coin—more convenient, more standardized, more trusted. That trust was real and valuable; merchants paid a premium for it.

But the trust rested on a claim that eventually became false. The officials who approved secret lending probably thought they could manage it. The loans would be repaid; the reserves would be restored; no one would know. For decades, they were right. Then a war created stress the system couldn't absorb.

The lesson isn't that fiat money is impossible—modern economies run on it. The lesson is that fiat money requires genuine constraints, not just promises. The Bank's founders understood this; they prohibited lending. Later officials thought they could bend the rules. The market eventually delivered its verdict.
