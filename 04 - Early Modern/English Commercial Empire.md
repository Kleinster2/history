# English Commercial Empire

England learned from the Dutch and added military power. The Glorious Revolution (1688) secured property rights and parliamentary control of taxation. The Bank of England (1694) created reliable public finance. The East India Company combined commerce with conquest. By 1800, Britain commanded the world's largest empire, most powerful navy, and first industrial economy. English institutions—Dutch finance plus military power plus coal—became the template for modern capitalism.

## The Deeper Point

Britain combined [[Dutch Golden Age Model|Dutch]] finance with military power—and won. The Glorious Revolution created credible commitment: Parliament controlled taxation, courts enforced property rights, the crown couldn't expropriate. This enabled the Bank of England and national debt, which enabled Britain to outspend France in every war. The East India Company showed how corporations could become empires, extracting wealth at continental scale. The Atlantic economy showed how slavery and sugar could generate capital and demand. And coal—Britain's geological luck—enabled mechanization when high wages made labor expensive. The result: the [[Industrial Revolution]]. But causation is contested. Did empire cause industrialization, or would Britain have industrialized anyway? The honest answer: probably both mattered. Empire provided markets, capital, raw materials (cotton!), and the confidence of global power. But institutions—property rights, contracts, patents—channeled [[Innovation Economics|entrepreneurial ambition]] toward production rather than predation. The [[Institutions and Progress|English model]] became the template: adopt Dutch finance, secure property rights, invest in military power, build empire, industrialize. Others would follow the template—or resist it—for the next two centuries.
