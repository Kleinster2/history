# Iberian Extractive Model

Spain and Portugal conquered the Americas and extracted enormous wealth—silver from Potosí and Mexico, sugar from Brazil, labor from indigenous and enslaved African people. But extraction didn't build development. The encomienda and hacienda systems created institutions for extraction that persisted for centuries. Spanish silver flooded Europe but didn't industrialize Spain. The Iberian empires created the "resource curse" before the concept existed: wealth that corrupted institutions rather than building them.

## Overview

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Conquest | Americas, parts of Asia, Africa |
| Method | Military, religious, extraction |
| Wealth | Enormous (silver, sugar, labor) |
| Institutions | Encomienda, hacienda, slavery |
| Outcome | Extraction, not development |

## Conquest Institutions

### Encomienda

| Feature | Character |
|---------|-----------|
| Grant | Labor rights over indigenous |
| Obligation | Christianization, "protection" |
| Reality | Forced labor extraction |
| Duration | 16th-17th centuries |
| Transition | To other forms |

### Hacienda

| Feature | Character |
|---------|-----------|
| Structure | Large landed estate |
| Labor | Various forms of coercion |
| Production | Agriculture, mining |
| Persistence | Into 20th century |
| Legacy | Land concentration |

### Slavery

| Region | Scale |
|--------|-------|
| Brazil | Largest slave destination |
| Caribbean | Sugar islands |
| Mining | Some African labor |
| Duration | To 19th century |

## Silver Economy

### Scale of Extraction

| Source | Output |
|--------|--------|
| Potosí (Bolivia) | Largest silver mine in history |
| Zacatecas (Mexico) | Major producer |
| Total | 80%+ of world silver, 16th-17th c. |
| Value | Incalculable |

### Labor System

| System | Character |
|--------|-----------|
| Mita | Forced indigenous labor |
| Conditions | Brutal, high mortality |
| Workers | Rotated from communities |
| Resistance | Ongoing, suppressed |

### Where Silver Went

| Destination | Effect |
|-------------|--------|
| Spain | Crown revenue |
| Europe | Price revolution |
| Asia | Bought goods (via Manila) |
| Inflation | Prices rose across Europe |

## Economic Effects on Spain

### The "Resource Curse"

| Effect | Mechanism |
|--------|-----------|
| Dutch Disease | Imports instead of production |
| No industrialization | Bought manufactures with silver |
| State expansion | Financed wars, not development |
| Corruption | Silver corrupted institutions |

### Comparison

| Spain | Netherlands/England |
|-------|---------------------|
| Silver wealth | Commerce, manufactures |
| Imported goods | Produced goods |
| Decline 17th c. | Rise 17th c. |
| Resource curse | Resource-poor but growing |

### Why Spain Didn't Develop

| Factor | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| Easy wealth | No need to innovate |
| Crown spending | Wars, not investment |
| Institutions | Extractive, not productive |
| Expulsion | Jews, Moriscos (lost skills) |

## Colonial Institutions

### The Persistence Problem

| Colonial institution | Post-independence |
|---------------------|-------------------|
| Hacienda | Land concentration continued |
| Labor coercion | Various forms persisted |
| Inequality | Extreme, persistent |
| State | Weak, captured by elites |

### Acemoglu-Johnson-Robinson Thesis

| Argument | Evidence |
|----------|----------|
| Extractive colonies | Got extractive institutions |
| Persistence | Institutions outlasted colonialism |
| Reversal | Once-rich areas now poor |
| Mechanism | Colonial institutions shaped development |

### [[Latin American Development]] Legacy

| Pattern | Persistence |
|---------|-------------|
| Inequality | Highest in world |
| Land concentration | Continued |
| State capture | Elite control |
| Underdevelopment | Relative to potential |

## Brazilian Variation

### Sugar Economy

| Feature | Character |
|---------|-----------|
| Plantation | Large-scale monoculture |
| Labor | African slavery |
| Exports | Sugar to Europe |
| Profits | Enormous |

### Compared to Spanish America

| Brazil | Spanish America |
|--------|-----------------|
| Sugar, later gold | Silver primarily |
| Slavery dominant | Mixed labor systems |
| Less urbanization | More urban centers |
| Similar | Extractive institutions |

## The Deeper Point

The Iberian empires demonstrate that wealth doesn't create development—[[Institutions and Progress|institutions]] determine whether wealth builds capacity or corrupts it. Spain extracted more silver than any empire in history, yet by 1700 was an economic backwater while the Netherlands and England were rising. The difference: extraction versus production. Spanish institutions were designed to funnel wealth from colonies to crown; there was no incentive to build productive capacity. Why manufacture when you can buy with silver? Why invest when the crown will tax? The encomienda and hacienda created extraction machines that persisted for centuries, concentrating land, coercing labor, and excluding most people from economic participation. Post-independence, these institutions didn't disappear—they were inherited. [[Latin American Development|Latin America's]] persistent inequality traces directly to colonial institutional origins. The resource curse worked through institutions: easy wealth corrupted the incentives for building productive [[Innovation Economics|innovation]]. The contrast with institutionally constrained European states—where merchants had power, property rights were secure, and rulers couldn't easily extract—shows that it's not wealth that matters but what institutions do with it.
