# Colonial Extraction Mechanisms

Beyond slavery and plantations—how did extraction institutions work? Colonial powers created institutional templates for transferring wealth from colonies to metropoles. Encomienda, mita, hacienda, plantation—each was a distinct mechanism for extracting labor, resources, and surplus. These institutions persisted long after independence, shaping Latin American inequality and development paths for centuries.

## Encomienda

### Spanish Labor Tribute System

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Grant | Crown assigned indigenous communities to colonist |
| Obligation | Tribute in labor or goods |
| Duration | Lifetime of holder (theoretically) |
| Justification | Protection and Christian instruction |
| Peak | 16th century |

### How It Worked

| Element | Mechanism |
|---------|-----------|
| Assignment | Royal grant of indigenous labor |
| Tribute | Fixed payments in goods or service |
| No land grant | Labor only, not territory |
| Inheritance | Initially non-hereditary |
| Abuse | Widespread despite regulations |

### Economic Function

| Purpose | Outcome |
|---------|---------|
| Reward conquistadors | Without crown expenditure |
| Mobilize labor | For mining, agriculture |
| Collect tribute | Colonial revenue |
| Control population | Administrative structure |

### Decline

| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Population collapse | 90% indigenous mortality |
| Crown opposition | Feared feudal power |
| New Laws (1542) | Attempted abolition |
| Transition | Repartimiento, wage labor |

## Mita

### Andean Forced Mining Labor

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Origin | Adapted from Inca mit'a |
| Location | Potosí silver mines, Huancavelica mercury |
| System | Rotational forced labor |
| Duration | 4 months per stint |
| Scale | 13,000 workers per year at Potosí |

### How It Worked

| Element | Mechanism |
|---------|-----------|
| Rotation | Each community sent quota |
| Distance | Some walked 100+ days |
| Wages | Nominal, far below market |
| Conditions | Extremely dangerous |
| Mortality | High death rates |

### Economic Logic

| Extraction | Method |
|------------|--------|
| Below-market wages | Difference = surplus extracted |
| Externalized costs | Communities bore travel, mortality |
| Continuous supply | Rotation ensured labor flow |
| State enforcement | Crown mandated service |

### Effects

| Impact | Consequence |
|--------|-------------|
| Silver output | Sustained Potosí production |
| Community devastation | Depopulation, impoverishment |
| Institutional persistence | Similar systems continued |
| Long-run inequality | Regions with mita poorer today |

## Hacienda

### Land Concentration System

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Origin | 17th century consolidation |
| Scale | Vast estates, thousands of hectares |
| Labor | Debt peonage, sharecropping |
| Production | Cattle, grain, sugar, mixed |
| Duration | Persisted into 20th century |

### Labor Control

| Mechanism | Function |
|-----------|----------|
| Debt peonage | Workers owed, couldn't leave |
| Company store | Hacienda monopoly, perpetual debt |
| Land monopoly | No alternative employment |
| Legal enforcement | Debt inherited, escapees returned |
| Housing | Workers lived on hacienda |

### Economic Structure

| Characteristic | Effect |
|----------------|--------|
| Self-sufficiency | Limited market integration |
| Underutilized land | Held for control, not production |
| Low productivity | Little incentive to improve |
| Political power | Hacendados dominated politics |

### Why Haciendas Persisted

| Factor | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| Land monopoly | No alternative for workers |
| Political power | Owners controlled law |
| Debt bondage | Workers couldn't escape |
| Low opportunity cost | Land abundant, labor scarce |

## Plantation System

### Caribbean and Brazilian Model

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Crops | Sugar, then cotton, coffee, tobacco |
| Labor | African slaves |
| Scale | Large, capital-intensive |
| Markets | Export-oriented |
| Ownership | Absentee common |

### How Plantations Worked

| Element | Mechanism |
|---------|-----------|
| Gang labor | Organized, supervised work |
| Violence | Coercion maintained discipline |
| Specialization | Single crop dominance |
| Capital | Mills, equipment, slave purchase |
| Management | Overseers, drivers |

### Economic Characteristics

| Feature | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| Economies of scale | Large operations more efficient |
| Capital intensity | High fixed costs |
| Export orientation | Global commodity markets |
| Profit extraction | Surplus to metropole |

### Comparison With Hacienda

| Dimension | Plantation | Hacienda |
|-----------|------------|----------|
| Labor | Slaves | Peons |
| Market | Export | Often subsistence |
| Intensity | Maximum extraction | Lower pressure |
| Capital | High | Low |
| Productivity | Higher | Lower |

## Comparative Analysis

### Why Different Systems?

| System | Where | Why |
|--------|-------|-----|
| Encomienda | Densely populated areas | Existing tribute systems |
| Mita | Andes | Mining labor needs |
| Hacienda | Frontier, post-encomienda | Land available, labor scarce |
| Plantation | Islands, coast | Sugar economics, slave supply |

### Extraction Intensity

| System | Extraction Level | Labor Source |
|--------|------------------|--------------|
| Encomienda | High | Indigenous tribute |
| Mita | Very high | Forced rotation |
| Hacienda | Medium | Debt peonage |
| Plantation | Maximum | Slavery |

### Institutional Persistence

| Colonial Institution | Post-Independence Form |
|---------------------|----------------------|
| Encomienda | Abolished, but... |
| Mita | Continued informally |
| Hacienda | Persisted until land reform |
| Plantation | Continued with wage labor |

## Why Extraction Persisted

### Path Dependence

| Factor | Mechanism |
|--------|-----------|
| Land concentration | Already consolidated |
| Elite power | Controlled independence |
| Labor coercion | Legal frameworks preserved |
| Ideology | Racial hierarchy naturalized |
| External markets | Commodity dependence |

### [[Reversal of Fortune]] Thesis

| Observation | Explanation |
|-------------|-------------|
| Rich in 1500 → poor today | Extractive institutions |
| Poor in 1500 → rich today | Settler institutions |
| Mechanism | Institutions, not resources |
| Persistence | Colonial patterns lasted |

## The Deeper Point

Colonial extraction created institutional templates that persisted long after independence—the path dependence of exploitation. [[Spanish Empire Economy|Encomienda]], [[Silver Economy|mita]], hacienda, and [[Sugar Economy|plantation]] were distinct mechanisms for mobilizing labor and extracting surplus, each adapted to local conditions. But all shared a common logic: institutions designed for extraction rather than production. When Latin American countries became independent, elites inherited these extractive institutions and had little incentive to change them. [[Latin American Development|Land concentration]], labor coercion, and export dependence continued. The [[Reversal of Fortune]] Acemoglu-Johnson-Robinson thesis finds its institutional mechanisms here: places with dense pre-colonial populations (easy to extract from) got extractive institutions that persisted; places with sparse populations got settler institutions that promoted development. [[Institutions and Progress|The institutional design choice]]—extraction vs. production—echoed for centuries. Reforming these institutions (land reform, labor rights, democratization) has been the central challenge of Latin American development.
