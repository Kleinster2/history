# Colonial Americas Economy

The colonization of the Americas created new economic systems built on conquest, extraction, and coerced labor. Four European powers—Spain, Portugal, Britain, and France—established different colonial models that shaped the economic trajectories of their territories for centuries. The colonial period established patterns of inequality, export dependence, and institutional structures that persist today.
