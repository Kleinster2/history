# Dutch Golden Age

The Dutch Republic was the world's first modern economy—pioneering the joint-stock company, the stock exchange, central banking, and financial markets that later shaped capitalism. A small, swampy country with few natural resources became the world's richest nation per capita, showing that institutions and innovation could trump geography.

## The VOC

| Charter | State-granted monopoly |
| Capital | 6.4 million guilders |
| Shareholders | 1,800 initial investors |
| Duration | Until 1799 |

### Corporate Innovations

|------------|--------------|
| Permanent capital | Unlike limited partnerships |
| Tradeable shares | Could sell stake |
| Limited liability | Risk capped at investment |

| Trade monopoly | East of Cape, west of Magellan |
| Make war | Against Asian powers |
| Make treaties | With local rulers |
| Establish forts | Military presence |
| Mint coins | Own currency |
| Govern territories | Quasi-state |

**The VOC was a state within a state—the first multinational corporation.**

### VOC Violence and the Indian Ocean

The VOC's dominance was built not on commercial superiority but on the destruction of existing free-trading civilizations in the Indian Ocean. Pre-existing maritime trading networks—with joint-stock ventures, systems of weights and measures, and law codes governing cargo—were functioning across the Indian Ocean before Europeans arrived. What these societies lacked were gunships.

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Portuguese precedent | Burned and blasted their way around the Indian Ocean circuit, breaking into pre-existing trading systems |
| VOC choke points | Controlled Straits of Malacca, Strait of Hormuz, Bab el-Mandeb |
| Fixed prices | Imposed monopoly pricing on formerly open trade |
| Banda Islands genocide | When Bandanese merchant oligarchy (no sultan — decisions made collectively) resisted VOC demands, Admiral Jan Pieterszoon Coen exterminated the entire population and replaced them with enslaved laborers on nutmeg plantations |
| Spice trade restructuring | Decimated existing nutmeg groves and replanted in locations the VOC could control |

### The Santa Catarina and International Law

The supposed foundations of modern international law trace directly to VOC piracy:

| Event | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| The act | Dutch forces captured the Portuguese spice ship *Santa Catarina* in the Straits of Singapore |
| The cargo | Worth approximately half the total stock value of the VOC |
| The justification | [[Hugo Grotius]] was hired to write *Mare Liberum* (1609) — a legal defense of the seizure that became the foundation text of international law |
| The irony | A defense of piracy became the root of the "rules-based international order" |

See [[Hugo Grotius]] for the full intellectual history.

### The Iberian Union Trigger

| Event | Consequence |
|-------|------------|
| Portuguese succession crisis | Portugal incorporated into Habsburg/Spanish Empire (Iberian Union, 1580) |
| Dutch cut off | Spain closed Dutch access to the spice trade that had funded their port cities and wars of independence |
| Dutch response | Founded VOC and began direct competition for Indian Ocean routes |
| Chinese withdrawal | Ming dynasty had ended overseas trade ~80 years before the Portuguese arrived, leaving a maritime power vacuum in the Indian Ocean |

### VOC Scale

| Measure | Peak |
|---------|------|
| Ships | ~4,700 (total built) |
| Employees | ~1 million (total employed) |
| Trade | Dominated Asian commerce |
| Dividends | 18% average annual |
| Market cap | Largest company in history (inflation-adjusted) |

### WIC (West India Company)

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Founded | 1621 |
| Focus | Atlantic trade, Americas |
| Activities | Slave trade, colonies, privateering |
