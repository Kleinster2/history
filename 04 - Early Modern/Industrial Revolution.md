# Industrial Revolution

The Industrial Revolution was the most important economic transformation in human history since the Neolithic. Beginning in Britain around 1760, it created sustained economic growth for the first time—ending millennia of Malthusian constraints and initiating the modern world of rising living standards, urbanization, and environmental impact. Understanding why it happened in Britain, and why then, is central to understanding global inequality.

| Culture | Scientific, entrepreneurial |

### The Allen Thesis

| Argument | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| High wages | Labor was expensive |
| Cheap energy | Coal was cheap |
| Incentive | Labor-saving innovation profitable |
| Contrast | Elsewhere, labor cheap, less incentive |

### Geographic Factors

| Factor | British Advantage |
|--------|-------------------|
| Coal location | Near ports, industry |
| Island | Naval power, defense |
| Rivers | Internal transport |
| Atlantic position | Trade access |

### Institutional Factors

| Factor | Argument |
|--------|----------|
| Glorious Revolution | Parliamentary control |
| Property rights | Secure |
| Patents | Innovation protected |
| Banking | Developed |
| Limited government | Less interference |

### Colonial Contribution

| Source | Contribution |
|--------|--------------|
| Cotton | Raw material |
| Sugar profits | Capital? |
| Markets | Export demand |
| Extraction | Wider debate |

### Social Networks

The [[Lunar Society]] of Birmingham exemplifies how personal networks of industrialists, scientists, and inventors drove innovation through collaboration and knowledge-sharing.

## The Deeper Point

The Industrial Revolution is the event this entire vault orbits: the moment economic growth became self-sustaining rather than cyclical. Every earlier society hit Malthusian ceilings—more people, eventually less per capita. Britain broke through because its [[Institutions and Progress|institutional]] framework made [[Innovation Economics|innovation]] more profitable than rent-seeking for the first time in history. Patents rewarded inventors; [[Property Rights|property rights]] secured investment; low barriers to entry prevented guilds from blocking new methods; scientific culture valorized practical knowledge; capital markets funded experimentation. None of these were uniquely British—the Dutch had most, Song China had some—but Britain had all of them simultaneously, in a society where coal was cheap, labor was expensive, and Atlantic trade provided both demand and raw materials. The question isn't simply "why did it happen?" but "why only once, and why there?" The answer isn't geography or culture or resources—it's the institutional configuration that made the sustained application of knowledge to production individually rational. Once that threshold was crossed, growth became self-reinforcing: innovation raised incomes, raised demand, funded more innovation. The Malthusian trap was an institutional prison, and the Industrial Revolution was the key.
