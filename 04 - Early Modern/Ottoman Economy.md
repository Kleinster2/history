# Ottoman Economy

The Ottoman Empire was one of the great early modern powers—straddling three continents, controlling key trade routes, and lasting over 600 years. At its peak, Ottoman economic institutions were sophisticated and effective. But by 1800, the empire was falling behind Europe, becoming the "sick man" dependent on foreign loans. The Ottoman trajectory is central to understanding why the Middle East, once the world's commercial hub, became peripheral to industrial modernity.
