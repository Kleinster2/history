# Chartered Company Model

Why did chartering matter for VOC, EIC, Hudson's Bay? Chartered companies solved the capital-pooling problem for risky long-distance ventures—but their monopoly grants created extraction incentives. The state granted exclusive trading rights, governance powers, and legal personality in exchange for revenue and geopolitical extension. This hybrid of public authority and private profit created history's most powerful corporations—and eventually, some of its most extractive institutions.

## The Legal Form

### What a Charter Granted

| Element | Content |
|---------|---------|
| Monopoly | Exclusive trade in specified region |
| Governance | Authority over employees, agents, territory |
| Legal personality | Sue, be sued, own property |
| Perpetual life | Outlast individual investors |
| Share transferability | Stock tradeable |
| Limited liability | Investors risk only investment |

### State-Company Relationship

| State Grants | Company Provides |
|--------------|------------------|
| Monopoly rights | Revenue (customs, dividends) |
| Treaty-making power | Geopolitical extension |
| Territorial governance | Cost savings (no direct rule) |
| Naval support | Strategic presence |
| Legal backing | Trade expansion |

## VOC Innovations

### Dutch East India Company (1602-1799)

| Feature | Innovation |
|---------|------------|
| Permanent capital | Not voyage-based (unlike predecessors) |
| Transferable shares | First stock exchange listing |
| Scale | 6,000+ employees, 100+ ships |
| Governance | Directors (Heeren XVII), chambers |
| Dividends | Average 18% over 200 years |

### Why VOC Succeeded

| Factor | Mechanism |
|--------|-----------|
| Capital pooling | Small investors could participate |
| Risk distribution | Loss spread across shareholders |
| Professional management | Directors not owners |
| State backing | Dutch navy supported |
| First mover | Established before competitors |

### VOC Governance Structure

| Level | Function |
|-------|----------|
| Heeren XVII | Central directors |
| Six chambers | Regional organization |
| Asia headquarters | Batavia (Jakarta) |
| Factories | Trading posts throughout Asia |
| Governor-General | Chief executive in Asia |

## EIC Evolution

### English East India Company (1600-1874)

| Period | Character |
|--------|-----------|
| 1600-1700 | Trading company, competing with Dutch |
| 1700-1757 | Commercial expansion, factory system |
| 1757-1858 | Territorial ruler (after Plassey) |
| 1858-1874 | Dissolved after Mutiny |

### From Trade to Rule

| Stage | Transformation |
|-------|----------------|
| Factories | Trading posts, by local permission |
| Fortification | Armed defense of trade |
| Alliances | Indian rulers as partners |
| Conquest | Military victories (Plassey, Buxar) |
| Administration | Revenue collection, governance |
| Sovereignty | De facto ruler of India |

### The Extraction Question

| Phase | Orientation |
|-------|-------------|
| Trading company | Profit from commerce |
| Revenue extraction | Profit from taxation |
| Deindustrialization | India supplied raw materials |
| Capital drain | Profits repatriated |

## Comparisons: Success and Failure

### Successful Companies

| Company | Duration | Key to Success |
|---------|----------|----------------|
| VOC | 1602-1799 | First mover, Dutch finance |
| EIC | 1600-1874 | Adapted, became territorial |
| Hudson's Bay | 1670-present | Geographic monopoly, furs |

### Failed Companies

| Company | Problem |
|---------|---------|
| French East India Company | State interference, undercapitalized |
| Swedish East India Company | Too small, limited capital |
| Danish East India Company | Competition, lack of naval power |
| Royal African Company | Lost monopoly, competition |

### What Determined Outcomes?

| Factor | Success | Failure |
|--------|---------|---------|
| Capital | Adequate, patient | Insufficient |
| State support | Consistent | Inconsistent |
| Competition | Managed | Overwhelming |
| Governance | Effective | Corrupt/incompetent |
| Geography | Strategic position | Marginal location |

## Institutional Design

### Solving the Capital Problem

| Challenge | Solution |
|-----------|----------|
| Large capital needed | Pooling from many investors |
| Long time horizon | Permanent capital |
| Illiquidity | Transferable shares |
| Risk | Limited liability |
| Agency | Professional management |

### Creating Extraction Incentives

| Feature | Extraction Risk |
|---------|-----------------|
| Monopoly | No competition to discipline |
| Distance | Home oversight impossible |
| Armed | Violence as business tool |
| Governance power | Tax what you trade |
| Short-term shareholders | Pressure for dividends |

## The Extraction Transition

### When Did Companies Become Extractive?

|-----------|-------------------|
| Violence | Used for market control |
| Territory | Acquired beyond trade needs |
| Taxation | Revenue from subjects |
| Deindustrialization | Local industry destroyed |
| Capital drain | Profits repatriated |

### EIC as Case Study

| Revenue farming | Squeezed peasants |
| Textile policy | Destroyed Indian industry |
| Land taxation | Zamindari exploitation |
| Drain of wealth | Profits to Britain |
| Famine | Administrative failure (Bengal 1770) |

## Legacy

### Corporate Evolution

| Chartered Company Feature | Modern Descendant |
|---------------------------|-------------------|
| Limited liability | Standard corporate form |
| Transferable shares | Stock markets |
| Professional management | Managerial capitalism |
| Perpetual life | Corporate continuity |
| Governance powers | No (states reclaimed) |
| Monopoly | Antitrust limits |

### Institutional Path

| Era | Form |
|-----|------|
| Medieval | Voyage-based partnerships |
| 1600s | Chartered monopolies |
| 1800s | Free-trade companies |
| 1900s | Modern corporations |
| 2000s | Multinational platforms |

## The Deeper Point

Chartered companies solved the capital-pooling problem for risky long-distance ventures—[[Business Firm|corporate innovations]] like permanent capital, transferable shares, and limited liability enabled trade at scale that partnerships couldn't achieve. But their monopoly grants created extraction incentives. Without competition, companies could exploit rather than serve. With governance powers, they became states. With distance from oversight, they acted without accountability. The [[East India Companies|VOC and EIC]] represent both triumph and tragedy: institutional innovation enabling unprecedented commercial expansion, but also extraction that impoverished colonies. The modern corporation inherited the financial innovations—pooled capital, limited liability, stock trading—while shedding the monopoly and governance powers that enabled extraction. The charter model solved one problem ([[Medieval Financial Innovation|how to pool capital]]) while creating another (how to prevent extraction). [[Institutions and Progress|Institutional design]] always involves trade-offs; the chartered company model's trade-off was productivity vs. power.
