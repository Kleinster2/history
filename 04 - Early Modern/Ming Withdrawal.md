# Ming Withdrawal

Why did the world's largest economy opt out? The Zheng He voyages demonstrated China's technological capability—the decision to withdraw was [[Institutions and Progress|institutional]], not technological.

## The Zheng He Voyages (1405-1433)

### Scale

| Dimension | Chinese Fleet | European Comparison |
|-----------|---------------|---------------------|
| Largest ships | 400+ feet long | Columbus's ships 85 feet |
| Fleet size | 300+ vessels | Da Gama had 4 ships |
| Crew | 27,000+ men | Hundreds |
| Range | China to East Africa | Coastal European voyages |

### Seven Voyages

| Voyage | Dates | Destination |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| 1st | 1405-07 | Java, Sumatra, Ceylon, Calicut |
| 2nd | 1407-09 | Same region |
| 3rd | 1409-11 | Malacca, Ceylon |
| 4th | 1413-15 | Hormuz (Persian Gulf) |
| 5th | 1417-19 | Hormuz, Aden, East Africa |
| 6th | 1421-22 | East Africa (Mogadishu) |
| 7th | 1431-33 | Hormuz, Mecca, East Africa |

### Purposes

| Objective | Implementation |
|-----------|----------------|
| Tribute collection | Demonstrate Ming power |
| Diplomatic | Establish relationships |
| Commercial | State-controlled trade |
| Display | Show Chinese superiority |
| **Not colonization** | No permanent settlements |

## The Decision to Withdraw

### Timeline

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| 1433 | Last voyage returns |
| 1436 | Construction of seagoing ships banned |
| 1449 | Mongol threat renewed (Tumu Crisis) |
| 1500 | Death penalty for building two-masted ships |
| 1525 | Destruction of seagoing vessels ordered |
| 1567 | Some maritime trade legalized |

### The Haijin (Sea Ban)

| Policy | Content |
|--------|---------|
| Private trade banned | Only tribute missions allowed |
| Ship destruction | Vessels dismantled |
| Coastal evacuation | Populations moved inland (later) |
| Enforcement | Variable but persistent |

## Why Withdrawal?

### Explanations

#### 1. Court Politics

| Factor | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Zheng He faction | Eunuchs supported voyages |
| Confucian officials | Opposed "wasteful" expeditions |
| Post-Yongle Emperor | Less interested in expansion |
| Bureaucratic victory | Confucian literati won |

#### 2. Fiscal Priorities

| Calculation | Choice |
|-------------|--------|
| Voyages cost | Enormous state expenditure |
| Returns | Prestige, not profit |
| Northern frontier | Mongol threat immediate |
| Grand Canal | Diverted resources |
| **Opportunity cost** | Money spent on ships = less for army |

#### 3. Confucian Ideology

| Belief | Implication |
|--------|-------------|
| Agriculture primary | Trade secondary or corrupting |
| Self-sufficiency ideal | China has everything it needs |
| Foreign goods | Luxuries, not necessities |
| Merchants | Low social status |
| Tribute system | Foreigners come to China, not reverse |

#### 4. Geographic Focus

| Threat | Priority |
|--------|----------|
| Mongols | Northern frontier danger |
| Great Wall | Resources to defense |
| Capital moved | Beijing (near frontier) |
| Maritime threats | None from sea |

### The Contrast with Europe

| China | Europe |
|-------|--------|
| Unified empire | Competing states |
| Single decision | Many competitors |
| If emperor withdrew, China withdrew | If Portugal withdrew, Spain continued |
| **One veto point** | **No single veto** |

## Consequences

### For China

| Effect | Manifestation |
|--------|---------------|
| Ceded maritime trade | To Southeast Asians, then Europeans |
| Lost Indian Ocean | Portuguese arrived 1498 |
| Technological stagnation | Shipbuilding knowledge lost |
| Missed opportunities | Silver trade, colonial goods |

### For the World

| Development | Chinese Absence |
|-------------|-----------------|
| Portuguese expansion | No Chinese resistance |
| Spice trade | Europeans dominated |
| Silver flows | Europeans controlled |
| Indian Ocean | Became European sphere |

### The Counterfactual

| Question | Speculation |
|----------|-------------|
| If China continued | Would have met Portuguese in Indian Ocean |
| Technological superiority | Chinese fleet larger, more advanced |
| Possible outcome | Chinese-dominated Indian Ocean trade? |
| **Why counterfactual matters** | Shows withdrawal was choice, not necessity |

## The "Great Divergence" Connection

### Pomeranz's Argument

| Claim | Evidence |
|-------|----------|
| China economically comparable to Europe until 1800 | Living standards, technology |
| Divergence late | Coal, colonies made difference |
| Ming withdrawal | Part of different path, not "backwardness" |

### The Institutional Reading

| Factor | Implication |
|--------|-------------|
| Centralized decision-making | One court could stop everything |
| No competing states | No Portugal/Spain rivalry to drive expansion |
| Bureaucratic interests | Confucian officials opposed merchants |
| **Institutions shaped choices** | Not technology or capability |

## Partial Revival: Silver Trade

### Despite Haijin

| Development | Scale |
|-------------|-------|
| Smuggling | Massive |
| Wokou pirates | Dominated trade |
| Portuguese arrival | Macau (1557) |
| Silver imports | American silver via Philippines |

### Ming Monetary Demand

| Pattern | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| Silver taxation (Single Whip) | Created demand for silver |
| Global silver flows | 1/3 of American silver → China |
| Trade imbalance | China exported silk, tea, porcelain |
| Partial integration | Into global economy |

## The Deeper Point

Ming withdrawal shows how [[Institutions and Progress|institutional choices]]—not technological capacity—determined global economic leadership. China had the technological capability to dominate maritime trade. Zheng He's fleet was larger and more advanced than anything Europe would produce for centuries. The decision to stop was political, not technological.

The crucial institutional difference was political fragmentation. In Europe, if one kingdom withdrew from exploration, competitors continued. Columbus was rejected by Portugal—so he went to Spain. No single decision-maker could stop European expansion. In China, when the court decided to stop, China stopped.

This reveals a paradox of political unity: China's centralized state could mobilize resources for massive projects (Great Wall, Grand Canal, treasure fleet) but could also halt them by a single decision. Europe's fragmentation was "wasteful" (endless wars, duplication of effort) but also meant no single veto could stop innovation.

The [[Why China Didn't Industrialize|Great Divergence]] may have started here—not with industrialization, but with the institutional structures that allowed or prevented certain kinds of activity. China made a choice. Europe, structurally, couldn't make that choice because there was no single Europe to decide.
