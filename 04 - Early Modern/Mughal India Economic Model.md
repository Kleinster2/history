# Mughal India Economic Model

Mughal India was among the world's wealthiest economies—its textile industry was the largest on earth, its merchants dominated Indian Ocean trade, its GDP may have exceeded Europe's. Yet this wealth was extracted, not invested. The zamindari system collected revenue without developing agriculture. Merchants prospered at the emperor's pleasure without political power. When the British East India Company transitioned from trade to conquest, it found an economy rich enough to plunder but institutionally unable to resist. Wealth without growth-enabling institutions proved insufficient.

## Overview

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Period | 1526-1857 (nominally to 1857) |
| Peak | 1600-1700 |
| Economy | Agrarian + world's largest manufactures |
| Share of world GDP | ~25% (1700) |
| Decline | 18th c. fragmentation, British conquest |

## Revenue System

### Zamindari

| Feature | Character |
|---------|-----------|
| Zamindars | Intermediary revenue collectors |
| Rights | Collect land revenue |
| Obligation | Remit to state |
| Status | Not owners, but not mere officials |
| Hereditary | Often became so |

### Revenue Extraction

| Method | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Assessment | Based on land productivity |
| Collection | Zamindars responsible |
| Rate | High—often 40-50% of output |
| Incentives | Short-term extraction |

### Comparison

| Mughal | European |
|--------|----------|
| High extraction | Variable, often lower |
| Intermediary collection | Direct in some places |
| No peasant property | Peasant property emerged |
| Revenue for court | Some reinvestment |

## Manufacturing

### Textile Industry

| Feature | Scale |
|---------|-------|
| Output | World's largest |
| Quality | Finest cottons, silks |
| Workers | Millions of weavers |
| Exports | Global reach |
| Regions | Bengal, Gujarat, Coromandel |

### Organization

| Structure | Character |
|-----------|-----------|
| Artisans | Individual or small workshop |
| Merchants | Putting-out system |
| Castes | Occupational specialization |
| Capital | Merchant advances |

### Why No Industrialization?

| Factor | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| Cheap labor | No incentive to mechanize |
| No coal | Different resource base |
| Institutions | No merchant political power |
| Later | British deliberately destroyed |

## Trade Networks

### Merchant Communities

| Community | Role |
|-----------|------|
| Gujarati merchants | Indian Ocean trade |
| Marwaris | Internal trade, finance |
| Chettis | Southeast Asian trade |
| Banias | Commercial caste |

### [[Indian Ocean Trade]]

| Pattern | Character |
|---------|-----------|
| Exports | Textiles, indigo, saltpeter |
| Imports | Gold, silver, horses |
| Partners | Southeast Asia, Middle East, Europe |
| Balance | Favorable (silver imports) |

### Banking (Shroffs and Hundis)

| Institution | Function |
|-------------|----------|
| Shroffs | Bankers, money changers |
| Hundis | Bills of exchange |
| Networks | Across India |
| Credit | Commercial finance |
| Limitation | Merchant subordination |

## Merchant Position

### Wealth Without Power

| Reality | Comparison |
|---------|------------|
| Merchants wealthy | Like Venice, Amsterdam |
| But no political power | Unlike Venice, Amsterdam |
| At ruler's pleasure | Could be expropriated |
| Caste limitations | Occupational constraints |
| No communes | No merchant self-governance |

### Institutional Limits

| Constraint | Effect |
|------------|--------|
| Imperial authority | Merchants subordinate |
| Caste | Limited mobility |
| Property | Insecure against state |
| Military | State monopoly |

## British Conquest

### Why Conquest Was Possible

| Factor | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| Fragmentation | Mughal decline, successor states |
| Division | Indian states fought each other |
| EIC advantages | Organizational, financial |
| Military | European tactics, discipline |

### Economic Consequences

| Effect | Mechanism |
|--------|-----------|
| Revenue extraction | Continued, intensified |
| Deindustrialization | Indian textiles destroyed |
| Drain of wealth | Tribute to Britain |
| Market capture | Forced to buy British goods |

### [[Colonial India]]

| Policy | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Land revenue | Continued extraction |
| Free trade | One-way (for Britain) |
| Railways | For extraction, not development |
| Famine | Market failures, policy failures |

## The Deeper Point

Mughal India was rich but not developing. Its textile industry was the world's largest; its merchants were sophisticated; its share of global GDP was immense. But [[Institutions and Progress|institutions]] channeled wealth toward court consumption and military maintenance rather than productive investment. Zamindars extracted revenue without improving agriculture. Merchants prospered but couldn't translate wealth into political power—there were no Indian [[Comparative Medieval Institutions|communes]] where those who created wealth made the rules. The caste system channeled [[Innovation Economics|entrepreneurial ambition]] into hereditary occupations rather than open competition. When the British arrived, they found an economy rich enough to plunder—and did. Deindustrialization followed as British policy deliberately destroyed Indian textiles to create markets for Lancashire. The contrast with Europe is instructive: Mughal India had commerce, manufactures, and sophistication, but not the institutional framework that turned wealth into growth. The [[East India Companies|East India Company]] didn't just conquer India militarily—it displaced institutions that extracted wealth with institutions that extracted wealth *and* exported it. Colonial India's poverty was not despite Mughal wealth but partly because Mughal institutions hadn't created the defenses that European institutional development provided.
