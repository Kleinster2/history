# Portuguese Empire

The Portuguese Empire—the first and longest-lasting of European colonial empires (1415-1999)—pioneered the sea route to Asia, established the transatlantic slave trade, and created a global commercial network. Unlike later territorial empires, Portugal's Estado da India was primarily a network of coastal trading posts. The empire's economic significance lay in connecting Asian spices, African slaves, and Brazilian sugar to European markets.
