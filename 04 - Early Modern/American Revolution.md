# American Revolution

The American Revolution was an economic event as much as a political one. Britain's richest and most commercially developed colonies rebelled not from poverty but from prosperity—and from resistance to imperial policies that threatened colonial economic autonomy. The revolution's outcome created a new nation facing the challenge of building economic institutions from scratch.
