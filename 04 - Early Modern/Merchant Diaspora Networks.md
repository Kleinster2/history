# Merchant Diaspora Networks

How did dispersed merchant communities enable long-distance trade? Merchant diasporas created trust networks that substituted for formal institutions—kinship and community as enforcement. Jewish Sephardim, Armenian Christians, Chinese sojourners, and Greek Orthodox merchants built trading systems spanning continents. Where states couldn't enforce contracts, diaspora networks provided the trust infrastructure that made commerce possible.

| Minority solidarity | Tighter enforcement than majority |
| Reputation | Community knowledge of behavior |
| Exclusion | Cheaters cut off |

### Greif's Coalition Theory

| Concept | Application |
|---------|-------------|
| Collective punishment | Cheater excluded by all |
| Information flow | Behavior known to community |
| Low transaction costs | Trust reduces verification |
| Self-enforcing | No need for external courts |

## Decline and Transformation

### Why Diasporas Declined

| Pressure | Effect |

| Nation-states | Loyalty questioned |
| Competition | Joint-stock companies |
| Integration | Diaspora members assimilated |
| Formal institutions | Courts, contracts replaced networks |
| Technology | Telegraph reduced information advantage |

### What Persisted

| Legacy | Modern Form |
|--------|-------------|
| Family business | Still important globally |
| Ethnic networks | Immigrant entrepreneurship |
| Trust advantages | Relationship-based commerce |
| [[Overseas Chinese Networks]] | Contemporary diaspora capitalism |

## The Deeper Point

Merchant diasporas created trust networks that substituted for formal institutions—[[Radhanites|kinship and community]] as enforcement. Where states couldn't reliably enforce contracts across borders, diaspora networks provided the infrastructure for long-distance trade. [[Jewish Diaspora Economy|Jewish]], Armenian, [[Overseas Chinese Networks|Chinese]], and Greek merchants succeeded precisely because their minority status created tight communities with strong internal enforcement. The threat of exclusion from community made cheating costly. Religious institutions, family ties, and reputation systems enabled commerce that formal legal systems couldn't support. But diasporas had limits: they couldn't scale beyond community, couldn't absorb outsiders easily, and faced discrimination from majority populations. The transition to impersonal market institutions—[[Ancient Contract Enforcement|courts that enforce]] contracts for anyone—eventually displaced diaspora advantages. What diasporas reveal is that [[Institutions and Progress|trust is an institution]]. Before formal enforcement existed, communities created informal enforcement through reputation and exclusion. Modern commerce retained some of this—relationship banking, repeat business, reputation—while adding formal legal infrastructure. The diaspora model shows what's possible without states; its decline shows why states became necessary for larger-scale commerce.
