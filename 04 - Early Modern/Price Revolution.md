# Price Revolution

The first global monetary shock. American silver flooded into Europe, tripling prices over 150 years—redistributing wealth, reshaping economies, and revealing why [[Institutions and Progress|monetary institutions]] matter.

## The Scale

### Price Increases

| Region | Price Change (1500-1650) |
|--------|--------------------------|
| Spain | Prices × 4-5 |
| England | Prices × 3-4 |
| France | Prices × 3 |
| Germany | Prices × 2-3 |
| Poland | Prices × 2 |

### Silver Flows

| Source | Quantity |
|--------|----------|
| Potosí (Bolivia) | 40,000+ tons (1545-1800) |
| Zacatecas (Mexico) | Major producer |
| Total American production | 150,000+ tons silver |
| Global impact | Largest monetary expansion in history to that point |

## The Mechanism

### Quantity Theory

| Concept | Application |
|---------|-------------|
| More money | Same goods |
| Result | Higher prices |
| Time lag | 50-100 years for full effect |
| Bodin (1568) | First monetary explanation |

### Transmission

| Stage | Process |
|-------|---------|
| American mines | Silver extracted |
| Spain | First recipient |
| European trade | Spread through commerce |
| Asian trade | Silver for spices, silk, porcelain |
| Global | First integrated monetary system |

## Winners and Losers

### Who Gained

| Group | Mechanism |
|-------|-----------|
| Debtors | Repaid in cheaper money |
| Agricultural producers | Food prices rose |
| Merchants | Trade profits |
| New wealth holders | Purchased depreciated assets |

### Who Lost

| Group | Mechanism |
|-------|-----------|
| Creditors | Received depreciated repayment |
| Fixed income | Rents, annuities, salaries lagged |
| Laborers | Wages lagged prices |
| Old nobility | Fixed feudal dues |
| Monasteries | Fixed rents on land |

### The Great Redistribution

| Transfer | Direction |
|----------|-----------|
| From lenders | To borrowers |
| From landlords | To tenants |
| From past wealth | To new wealth |
| From fixed claims | To flexible incomes |

## The Spanish Paradox

### Inflow Without Development

| Pattern | Manifestation |
|---------|---------------|
| Silver poured in | Largest recipient |
| Manufacturing declined | Couldn't compete with imports |
| Agriculture stagnated | Labor moved to cities, colonies |
| Debt accumulated | Wars consumed resources |
| Bankruptcy | Multiple state defaults |

### Why Spain Didn't Develop

| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Dutch disease | Real exchange rate appreciation |
| Imports | Cheaper than domestic production |
| Investment | In war, consumption, not industry |
| [[Resource Curse]] | Wealth without productive capacity |
| Institutional weakness | Crown debt, weak property rights |

### Hamilton's Thesis

| Claim | Content |
|-------|---------|
| Profit inflation | Prices rose faster than wages |
| Profits increased | Capital accumulated |
| Investment | Funded development in England, Netherlands |
| Spain exception | Resources consumed, not invested |

## Global Flows

### Silver to Asia

| Route | Scale |
|-------|-------|
| Via Manila | Galleon trade (1565-1815) |
| Via Europe | Through Ottoman, Indian Ocean |
| Destination | Primarily China |
| Share | 1/3 to 1/2 of American silver → Asia |

### Why Asia Absorbed Silver

| Factor | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| China's silver demand | Ming tax system required silver |
| Trade imbalance | Europe wanted Asian goods |
| Gold-silver ratio | Favorable in China |
| Indian demand | Monetary and jewelry use |

### The First Global Economy

| Connection | Manifestation |
|------------|---------------|
| American production | Mining |
| European intermediation | Trade, finance |
| Asian consumption | Manufactures for silver |
| Result | First truly global trade system |

## Regional Variations

### England

| Effect | Outcome |
|--------|---------|
| Later recipient | Inflation spread more gradually |
| Profit inflation | Thesis debated but influential |
| Agricultural prices | Rose, benefiting landlords |
| Enclosure incentive | Higher land values |

### Netherlands

| Effect | Outcome |
|--------|---------|
| Trade benefits | Carrying trade profits |
| Financial sophistication | Managing money flows |
| Less inflation | Trade spread money broadly |
| Silver as commodity | Amsterdam silver market |

### Eastern Europe

| Effect | Outcome |
|--------|---------|
| "Second serfdom" | Landlords exploited grain demand |
| Export agriculture | Grain to Western Europe |
| Labor coercion | Enserfment intensified |
| Divergence | East-West institutional split |

### Ottoman Empire

| Effect | Outcome |
|--------|---------|
| Inflation | Similar pattern to Europe |
| Military financing | Debasement compounded |
| Trade shift | American silver competed with Ottoman |
| Long-term decline | Contributing factor |

## Monetary Theory Development

### Jean Bodin (1568)

| Contribution | Content |
|--------------|---------|
| First explanation | American silver caused inflation |
| Quantity theory | More money → higher prices |
| Policy implication | Money supply matters |

### Later Developments

| Thinker | Contribution |
|---------|--------------|
| Locke | Monetary theory |
| Hume | Price-specie flow mechanism |
| Classical economists | Quantity theory formalized |

### Policy Implications

| Lesson | Application |
|--------|-------------|
| Money not wealth | Silver didn't enrich Spain |
| Monetary stability | Matters for trade, investment |
| Institutional response | Some countries adapted better |

## Connection to [[Great Divergence]]

### Different Responses

| Country | Response to Silver Inflow |
|---------|---------------------------|
| Spain | Consumed, borrowed, declined |
| Netherlands | Traded, invested, developed |
| England | Developed institutions, eventually industrialized |

### Institutional Filtering

| Factor | Outcome Difference |
|--------|-------------------|
| Property rights | Affected investment incentives |
| State capacity | Could it manage the shock? |
| Financial development | Could it channel funds? |
| Economic structure | Manufacturing or consumption? |

## The Deeper Point

The Price Revolution was the first global monetary shock—it revealed how commodity money could redistribute wealth and showed why [[Institutions and Progress|monetary institutions]] matter. The same silver inflow had radically different effects depending on the institutional context receiving it.

Spain received the most silver but declined economically. The [[Resource Curse]] operated in the 16th century: easy wealth undermined productive activity, funded consumption and war, and distorted economic incentives. English and Dutch [[Institutions and Progress|institutions]]—more secure property rights, better financial intermediation, more productive investment—channeled the monetary expansion differently.

The Price Revolution also created the first genuinely global economy. American silver flowed to China via Manila and Europe, connecting three continents in regular exchange. This wasn't just European expansion—it was Asian demand pulling silver eastward and American supply responding. The institutional frameworks (Chinese tax system, European trading companies, American mining operations) created an integrated system.

For monetary theory, the Price Revolution provided the first clear demonstration that money supply affects prices. Bodin's 1568 analysis began modern monetary thinking. The quantity theory—however simplified—emerged from observing American silver's effects. The lesson that money is not wealth, that silver-rich Spain could decline while resource-poor Netherlands flourished, became foundational to classical economics.
