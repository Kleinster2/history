# Enclosure

The privatization of English commons. Between 1750 and 1850, Parliamentary enclosure transformed millions of acres of common land into private property—one of history's largest redistributions of property rights. The process enabled agricultural improvement but dispossessed millions, creating the landless laborers who would staff industrial factories.

## What Was Enclosure?

### Before: The Open Field System

| Feature | Character |
|---------|-----------|
| Strip farming | Peasant plots scattered across fields |
| Common rights | Grazing, wood gathering, gleaning |
| Collective decisions | Village managed planting |
| Subsistence plus | Some market production |

### After: Enclosed Farms

| Feature | Character |
|---------|-----------|
| Consolidated holdings | Individual farms with fences |
| Private property | Full ownership, no common rights |
| Market orientation | Production for sale |
| Improvement incentive | Owner captures gains |

## Timeline

| Phase | Dates | Character |
|-------|-------|-----------|
| Early enclosure | 1400-1600 | Piecemeal, local agreements |
| Tudor concern | 1500s | Government worried about depopulation |
| Parliamentary | 1750-1850 | Systematic, legal process |
| Peak | 1760-1820 | ~4,000 acts, 6.8 million acres |
| Completion | 1850s+ | Most commons enclosed |

## The Parliamentary Process

| Step | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Petition | Large landowners request |
| Act | Parliament passes specific enclosure |
| Commissioners | Survey, allocate land |
| Costs | Legal fees, fencing—paid by recipients |
| Result | New property map, common rights abolished |

## Winners and Losers

### Winners

| Group | Gain |
|-------|------|
| Large landowners | Consolidated, improved estates |
| Commercial farmers | Efficient operations |
| Improvers | New techniques possible |
| Lawyers | Enclosure fees |

### Losers

| Group | Loss |
|-------|------|
| Cottagers | Lost common rights |
| Small freeholders | Couldn't afford costs, sold out |
| Squatters | Expelled |
| Rural poor | Subsistence margin eliminated |

## Economic Effects

### Agricultural Improvement

| Innovation | Enabled by Enclosure |
|------------|---------------------|
| Crop rotation | Individual decision-making |
| Selective breeding | Controlled herds |
| Drainage | Investment with secure returns |
| Experimentation | Risk-taking possible |

### Productivity Gains

| Measure | Change |
|---------|--------|
| Yields | Increased significantly |
| Labor productivity | Rose (fewer workers, more output) |
| Land productivity | Rose (better techniques) |
| Total output | Sufficient for growing population |

### Social Transformation

| Change | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Landless laborers | New class created |
| Rural exodus | Migration to cities |
| Wage dependence | No subsistence fallback |
| Factory labor supply | Industrial workforce |

## The Debate

### Efficiency View

| Argument | Evidence |
|----------|----------|
| Commons were inefficient | Tragedy of the commons |
| Enclosure enabled improvement | Productivity rose |
| Necessary for industrialization | Fed growing population |
| Market rationality | Property rights enable investment |

### Dispossession View

| Argument | Evidence |
|----------|----------|
| Commons worked | Sustainable for centuries |
| Enclosure was theft | Common rights abolished |
| Violence required | Resistance suppressed |
| Class project | Rich taking from poor |

### Modern Synthesis

| Point | Evidence |
|-------|----------|
| Both true | Efficiency gains AND dispossession |
| Distribution | Gains concentrated, costs diffused |
| Alternatives existed | Other paths possible |
| Power mattered | Large landowners controlled Parliament |

## Connection to Industrialization

### Labor Supply

| Link | Mechanism |
|------|-----------|
| Rural displacement | Push factor |
| Wage dependence | Must work for money |
| Factory discipline | No subsistence alternative |
| Urban migration | Where jobs were |

### Capital Accumulation

| Link | Mechanism |
|------|-----------|
| Agricultural profits | Investment capital |
| Landlord income | Reinvested |
| Food surplus | Fed urban workers |
| Raw materials | Wool for textiles |

## Comparative Cases

| Country | Enclosure Equivalent |
|---------|---------------------|
| Scotland | Highland clearances (more violent) |
| Ireland | Land consolidation under colonialism |
| Prussia | Junker estate consolidation |
| Russia | Stolypin reforms (attempted) |
| Global South | World Bank land titling programs |

## The Deeper Point

Enclosure shows how [[Property Rights|property rights]] changes create winners and losers. The economic case for enclosure—enabling improvement, increasing productivity, clarifying incentives—was real. Agricultural output increased, feeding a growing population and freeing labor for industry.

But efficiency isn't the whole story. The same changes that increased total output also redistributed it. Those who had relied on common rights—gleaning, grazing, wood gathering—lost their subsistence margin. They became wage laborers with nothing to sell but their labor.

The [[Institutions and Progress|institutional]] lesson is that property rights are never neutral. Every definition of property empowers some and disempowers others. The question isn't whether property rights matter—they always do—but whose interests the particular configuration serves. Enclosure served landowners and industrialists; it impoverished cottagers and smallholders.

The political economy of enclosure also matters. Parliament was controlled by landowners—the same people who benefited from enclosure. The process wasn't inevitable or natural; it was a political choice with economic consequences. Different institutions would have produced different outcomes.
