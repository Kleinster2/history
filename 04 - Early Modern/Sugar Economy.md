# Sugar Economy

Sugar built the Atlantic world. A luxury spice in medieval Europe became a mass commodity that reshaped continents—driving the largest forced migration in history (12 million enslaved Africans), creating the plantation system, enriching European merchants, and leaving a legacy that shapes the modern world. Sugar was the oil of the early modern era.

## Overview
