# Proto-industrialization

Before the factory, there was the putting-out system. Merchant-capitalists distributed raw materials to rural households, who spun, wove, and finished goods at home, returning the product for wages. This "domestic system" organized millions of workers across Europe for three centuries—and it was the direct ancestor of the factory. Proto-industrialization explains the transition from craft production to industrial capitalism: how merchants became employers, how peasants became wage workers, and why the factory was both a revolution and a logical next step.

## Overview

### The System

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Organizer | Merchant-capitalist (putter-out) |
| Worker | Rural household |
| Location | Home, cottage |
| Materials | Supplied by merchant |
| Product | Returned to merchant |
| Payment | Piece-rate wages |

### Why It Matters

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| What came before factories? | This system |
| How did capitalism start? | Merchants controlling production |
| How did workers become proletarians? | Lost independence gradually |
| Why factories? | Solved problems of putting-out |
| Where? | Primarily textile regions of Europe |

## How It Worked

### The Putting-Out Process

| Step | Actor |
|------|-------|
| 1. Buy raw materials | Merchant |
| 2. Distribute to households | Merchant's agents |
| 3. Spin yarn | Women, children (at home) |
| 4. Weave cloth | Men (at home, on loom) |
| 5. Collect finished goods | Merchant's agents |
| 6. Finish/dye/sell | Merchant |

### Who Did What

| Role | Function | Power |
|------|----------|-------|
| Merchant-clothier | Finance, materials, markets | High (controls access) |
| Master weaver | Skilled production | Medium (owns loom) |
| Spinners | Prepare yarn | Low (easily replaced) |
| Children | Auxiliary tasks | None |
| Finishing trades | Dyeing, fulling | Specialized |

### The Economics

| Feature | Logic |
|---------|-------|
| Why rural? | Cheaper labor than guilded towns |
| Why households? | No factory cost, workers own tools |
| Merchant's capital | Tied up in materials and inventory |
| Worker's income | Supplement to farming |
| Flexibility | Scale up/down with demand |

## Where It Flourished

### Major Regions

| Region | Product | Period |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Flanders | Wool cloth | 1200s-1500s |
| England (East Anglia, West Riding) | Wool, worsted | 1400s-1800s |
| Silesia | Linen | 1500s-1800s |
| Rhineland | Linen, metal | 1500s-1700s |
| Lyon | Silk | 1500s-1800s |
| India | Cotton textiles | Ancient-1800s |
| China | Silk, cotton | Ancient-1900s |

### Beyond Textiles

| Industry | Form |
|----------|------|
| Nail-making | Rural forges |
| Chain-making | Black Country (England) |
| Lace | Women's cottage work |
| Straw-plaiting | Seasonal |
| Watch parts | Swiss valleys |
| Cutlery | Sheffield region |

## The Transition from Craft to Putting-Out

### What Changed

| Craft/Guild System | Putting-Out System |
|--------------------|-------------------|
| Artisan owns materials | Merchant owns materials |
| Artisan sells product | Merchant sells product |
| Artisan sets price | Merchant sets piece-rate |
| Urban, regulated | Rural, unregulated |
| Independent producer | Dependent wage-worker |
| [[Guilds\|Guild]] protection | No protection |

### Why Merchants Won

| Factor | Mechanism |
|--------|-----------|
| Capital | Merchants had it; artisans didn't |
| Markets | Merchants had access; artisans were local |
| Guild restrictions | Towns regulated; countryside was free |
| Cheap labor | Rural workers accepted less |
| Scale | Merchants could coordinate hundreds |

### The Worker's Experience

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| Own your materials | Work on merchant's materials |
| Sell at market price | Accept piece-rate |
| Control your time | Deadlines, quotas |
| Multiple buyers | One merchant (dependency) |
| Craft identity | Wage identity |
| Gradual | Often didn't notice the shift |

## Problems of the Putting-Out System

### For Merchants

| Problem | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Embezzlement | Workers stole materials |
| Quality control | Couldn't supervise home work |
| Speed control | Workers set own pace |
| Bottlenecks | Spinning couldn't keep up with weaving |
| Capital tied up | Materials scattered across region |

### For Workers

| Problem | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Dependency | One buyer, no alternatives |
| Payment delays | Merchants paid when they chose |
| Truck system | Paid in goods, not cash |
| Rate cutting | Piece-rates fell over time |
| No bargaining power | Isolated, unorganized |

### The Factory as Solution

| Putting-Out Problem | Factory Solution |
|---------------------|-----------------|
| Can't supervise | Direct oversight |
| Embezzlement | Materials stay in one place |
| Variable quality | Standardized process |
| Slow pace | Clock discipline |
| Bottlenecks | Coordinated machinery |
| Scattered capital | Concentrated investment |

## The Transition to Factory

### Gradual, Not Sudden

| Stage | Character |
|-------|-----------|
| Pure putting-out | All work at home |
| Workshops | Some tasks centralized |
| Proto-factories | Water-powered, still hand processes |
| Early factories | Machines + discipline |
| Full factory | [[Industrial Revolution]] |

### Key Moments

| Innovation | Effect on Putting-Out |
|------------|----------------------|
| Spinning jenny (1764) | Productivity leap, but still home-based |
| Water frame (1769) | Required factory (water power) |
| Spinning mule (1779) | Factory-scale, skilled operators |
| Power loom (1785) | Weaving enters factory |
| Steam engine adaptation | Factory anywhere (not just rivers) |

### Resistance

| Response | Character |
|----------|-----------|
| Luddites (1811-16) | Smashed machines, defended craft |
| Handloom weavers | Held on for decades, starved out |
| Chartism | Political response to factory conditions |
| Combination Acts | Banned worker organization (1799-1824) |
| Outcome | Factory won everywhere |

## Global Proto-industrialization

### India

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Cotton textiles | World's largest industry (pre-1800) |
| Organization | Merchant-weaver putting-out |
| Quality | Finest cotton cloth globally |
| Destruction | British competition, deliberate policy |
| Result | [[Colonial India\|Deindustrialization]] under Empire |

### China

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Silk and cotton | Massive household production |
| Yangzi Delta | Most developed textile region |
| Organization | Similar to European putting-out |
| Debate | Why no factory transition? |
| Pomeranz thesis | Divergence from Europe late (post-1750) |

### Japan

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Tokugawa era | Rural manufacturing expands |
| Silk, cotton | Putting-out in villages |
| Transition | Smooth into Meiji factories |
| Difference | State-directed industrialization |

## Theories and Debates

### The Proto-industrialization Thesis (Mendels, 1972)

| Argument | Claim |
|----------|-------|
| Definition | Rural manufacturing for distant markets |
| Effect | Population growth (earlier marriage) |
| Capital accumulation | Merchants save for factories |
| Skill formation | Workers learn manufacturing |
| Regional path | Proto-industry → industry |

### Criticisms

| Critique | Evidence |
|----------|----------|
| Not all regions industrialized | Many proto-industrial areas declined |
| Not all factories came from putting-out | Some appeared without precursor |
| Teleological | Not every step leads to factories |
| Regional variation | Different paths, different outcomes |

### What It Explains

| Question | Proto-industrialization's Answer |
|----------|----------------------------------|
| Why Europe? | Capital accumulation, market orientation |
| Why textiles first? | Already organized, large market |
| Why rural areas? | Cheap labor, no guild restrictions |
| Why England? | Largest domestic system, coal nearby |

---

## Legacy

### What Proto-industrialization Created

| Development | Mechanism |
|-------------|-----------|
| Wage labor norm | Workers lost independence |
| Merchant capitalism | Merchants became employers |
| Rural proletariat | Landless workers available |
| Market orientation | Production for sale, not use |
| Gender division | Women spin, men weave → factory roles |

### Echoes Today

| Historical Form | Modern Equivalent |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| Putting-out | Gig economy, outsourcing |
| Merchant-capitalist | Platform company |
| Piece-rate | Per-task payment (Uber, TaskRabbit) |
| Home work | Remote work, digital piecework |
| Scattered production | Global supply chains |
