# Mughal Empire

The Mughal Empire (1526-1857)—founded by Babur, a descendant of both Timur and Genghis Khan—ruled most of the Indian subcontinent at its height. The Mughals presided over economic prosperity, integrating India into global trade networks and creating administrative systems that the British later adapted. Mughal India was one of the world's wealthiest economies, a major destination for global silver flows, and a center of textile production.
