# Early Modern Stock Markets

From Amsterdam Beurs to London Exchange—stock markets required institutional infrastructure that developed through crises. Price transparency, contract enforcement, speculation limits, and crisis management emerged through hard experience: tulip mania, South Sea, Mississippi bubbles. Each crash taught lessons that became institutional safeguards. The development of stock markets shows how financial institutions evolve through failure.

## Amsterdam Innovations

### The Beurs (1602+)

| Innovation | Date | Significance |
|------------|------|--------------|
| Continuous trading | 1602+ | Not just periodic fairs |
| Transferable shares | 1602 | VOC stock tradeable |
| Formal exchange | 1611 | Purpose-built building |
| Derivatives | 1620s | Options, futures contracts |
| Short selling | 1600s | Betting on decline |

### How Amsterdam Trading Worked

| Element | Practice |
|---------|----------|
| Location | Beurs building, open hours |
| Participants | Merchants, brokers, speculators |
| Products | VOC shares, government debt, commodities |
| Settlement | Periodic, monthly "rescontre" |
| Information | Price lists, news, rumors |

### VOC Share Trading

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| No certificates | Shares in company register |
| Transfer | Recorded by company officials |
| Price discovery | Continuous on Beurs floor |
| Speculation | Active secondary market |
| Dividends | Irregular, often in-kind |

### Derivatives Development

| Instrument | Function |
|------------|----------|
| Forward contracts | Future delivery, fixed price |
| Options | Right, not obligation |
| Short selling | Sell borrowed shares |
| Repos | Financing share positions |
| Speculation | Bet on price movements |

## Tulip Mania (1636-1637)

### The Bubble

| Phase | Development |
|-------|-------------|
| 1630s | Tulip cultivation expands |
| 1636 | Futures trading in taverns |
| Winter 1636-37 | Prices soar |
| February 1637 | Collapse |
| Aftermath | Contract disputes |

### What Happened

| Element | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| Product | Rare tulip bulbs, varieties |
| Venue | Tavern "colleges," not Beurs |
| Contracts | Future delivery, paper trading |
| Peak prices | Months of wages for single bulb |
| Collapse | No buyers at auction |

### Lessons

| Lesson | Interpretation |
|--------|----------------|
| Speculation risk | Prices can disconnect from value |
| Informal markets | Less regulated = more volatile |
| Contract enforcement | Courts refused to enforce |
| Limited contagion | Beurs itself unaffected |

## South Sea Bubble (1720)

### The Scheme

| Stage | Development |
|-------|-------------|
| 1711 | South Sea Company founded |
| 1720 | Debt-for-equity conversion proposed |
| Spring 1720 | Stock price soars |
| June 1720 | Peak at £1,000 |
| September 1720 | Collapse to £150 |

### How It Worked

| Element | Mechanism |
|---------|-----------|
| Debt conversion | Exchange government debt for shares |
| Stock promotion | Directors talked up price |
| Leverage | Installment purchases |
| Political support | MPs bribed with stock |
| Pyramid logic | New buyers fund old |

### Consequences

| Effect | Outcome |
|--------|---------|
| Investor losses | Massive wealth destruction |
| Political crisis | Walpole manages aftermath |
| Bubble Act (1720) | Restricted incorporation |
| Reform | Directors punished, some restitution |
| Long shadow | Restricted companies until 1825 |

## Mississippi Bubble (1720)

### John Law's System

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Banque Royale | Note-issuing bank |
| Mississippi Company | Louisiana development |
| Debt monetization | Converted French debt |
| Money creation | Printed notes freely |
| Integration | Bank + Company + State |

### Rise and Fall

| Phase | Development |
|-------|-------------|
| 1716 | Banque Générale founded |
| 1717 | Mississippi Company created |
| 1719 | Merger, share price soars |
| 1720 | Peak, then collapse |
| Aftermath | Law flees, system collapses |

### Why It Failed

| Factor | Problem |
|--------|---------|
| Overissuance | Too many notes printed |
| No real assets | Louisiana didn't produce |
| Confidence collapse | Once doubts began, spiral |
| Inflation | Prices rose as notes flooded |
| Gold preference | People wanted metal, not paper |

## London Exchange

### Coffee Houses to Formal Exchange

| Stage | Development |
|-------|-------------|
| 1690s | Jonathan's Coffee House trading |
| 1698 | Stock price list begins |
| 1720 | Crash, but trading continues |
| 1773 | New Jonathan's Coffee House opens |
| 1801 | Stock Exchange formally organized |

### Institutional Development

| Feature | Evolution |
|---------|-----------|
| Location | Coffee house → purpose-built |
| Membership | Open → restricted |
| Rules | Customs → formal regulations |
| Settlement | Periodic account days |
| Listing | Standards for companies |

### Products Traded

| Type | Examples |
|------|----------|
| Government debt | Consols (consolidated annuities) |
| Bank shares | Bank of England |
| Insurance | Marine, fire companies |
| Utilities | Canal companies, later railways |
| Foreign | Some European securities |

## Institutional Requirements

### What Made Stock Markets Work

| Requirement | Institutional Solution |
|-------------|----------------------|
| Price discovery | Public trading, price lists |
| Liquidity | Regular trading sessions |
| Settlement | Account days, clearinghouses |
| Information | Newspapers, company reports |
| Enforcement | Courts, membership discipline |
| Capital | Wealthy participants |

### Developed Through Crises

| Crisis | Institutional Response |
|--------|----------------------|
| Tulip mania | Courts refused enforcement |
| South Sea | Bubble Act, director penalties |
| Mississippi | Cautious about note-issuing |
| 1825 panic | Begin relaxing Bubble Act |
| 1866 Overend | Lender of last resort |

## The Deeper Point

Stock markets required institutional infrastructure—price transparency, contract enforcement, speculation limits—that developed through crises. [[Dutch Golden Age|Amsterdam]] pioneered continuous trading, transferable shares, and derivatives, creating the template. Tulip mania showed speculation dangers but was contained outside the formal Beurs. South Sea and Mississippi revealed how stock promotion, leverage, and political corruption could create catastrophic bubbles. Each crisis generated institutional responses: the Bubble Act restricted incorporation, courts developed contract doctrines, exchanges formalized membership and rules. [[Stock Markets|Modern stock markets]] inherit this institutional infrastructure. What early modern experience revealed is that markets don't regulate themselves—they require institutional design to channel speculation, provide transparency, and manage crises. The [[Financial Crises|pattern of bubbles and reform]] that began in 1720 continues today. [[Institutions and Progress|Institutions evolve through failure]]: each crash teaches lessons that become embedded in rules, regulations, and practices.
