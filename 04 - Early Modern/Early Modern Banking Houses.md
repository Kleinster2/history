# Early Modern Banking Houses

Medici, Fugger, Baring, Rothschild—family banking before central banks. These banking houses solved trust problems through kinship—family members in distant cities could be trusted where strangers couldn't. But they couldn't scale beyond family limits. The history of early modern banking is the history of family networks enabling international finance, and eventually being superseded by impersonal institutions that could grow larger.

## The Medici Model

### Florence (1397-1494)

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Structure | Holding company with branch partnerships |
| Branches | Rome, Venice, Geneva, Bruges, London |
| Partners | Family members and trusted managers |
| Capital | Medici family plus partners |

### How It Worked

| Element | Mechanism |
|---------|-----------|
| Branch autonomy | Each partnership separate liability |
| Central control | Florence coordinated strategy |
| Papal connection | Rome branch most profitable |
| Diversification | Banking, textiles, commodities |
| Political power | Banking enabled political control |

### Medici Innovations

|------------|--------------|
| Branch network | International without corporation |
| Partnership structure | Limited liability via separation |
| Papal banking | Stable, profitable client |
| Political leverage | Finance = power in Florence |

### Decline

| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Overextension | Loans to sovereigns who defaulted |
| Political distraction | Banking secondary to politics |

| Succession | Able founders, weaker heirs |
| Growth | Couldn't scale indefinitely |

### End of the Era

| Limited liability | 1855 made corporations safer |
| Deposit banking | Mass market beyond family |
| Investment banking | Still family-influenced |

## The Deeper Point

Family banking houses solved trust problems through kinship—[[Florence|Medici]] brothers in Rome and Bruges, [[Medieval Financial Innovation|Rothschild]] brothers across Europe, could be trusted where strangers couldn't. They enabled international finance before formal institutions existed: bills of exchange, sovereign lending, trade finance all flowed through family networks. But they couldn't scale beyond family limits. Talent was constrained to kin; capital was limited to family wealth; succession was uncertain. The transition to [[Central Banking|joint-stock banking]] and eventually [[Investment Banking|modern investment banks]] retained family influence (Rothschilds, Morgans, Warburgs) while adding impersonal capital and professional management. What families provided—trust across distance—was eventually replaced by formal institutions: legal contracts, regulated markets, corporate governance. The banking house era shows that [[Institutions and Progress|institutional development]] often begins with personal relationships and gradually becomes impersonal. Family solved the trust problem first; corporations solved the scale problem after.
