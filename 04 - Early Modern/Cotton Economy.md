# Cotton Economy

Cotton transformed the American South, fueled British industrialization, and entrenched slavery as the foundation of a vast economic system. Between 1790 and 1860, raw cotton became America's dominant export, linking Southern plantations to Lancashire mills in a transatlantic economy built on enslaved labor. The cotton economy made slavery more profitable than ever precisely when it might have declined—with consequences that led to civil war.

## Overview

### The Scale

| Year | US Cotton Production | Share of World |
|------|---------------------|----------------|
| 1790 | 1.5 million lbs | Negligible |
| 1820 | 335 million lbs | ~55% |
| 1840 | 835 million lbs | ~65% |
| 1860 | 2.3 billion lbs | ~75% |

### The Triangle

| Node | Role |
|------|------|
| American South | Grows cotton |
| British Lancashire | Manufactures textiles |
| Global markets | Buys cloth |

| Value | ~$3 billion (more than all US manufacturing) |
| Productivity | Forced labor extracted through violence |

### The Work

| Task | Description |

| Cultivation | Hoeing, thinning |
| Picking | Aug-Dec, brutal pace |
| Quotas | 150-200 lbs/day expected |
| Enforcement | Whipping for shortfalls |

## "King Cotton" Ideology

### The Argument

| Claim | Reasoning |
|-------|-----------|
| Cotton is indispensable | World economy depends on it |

| Test | Result |
|------|--------|
| Civil War | Britain didn't intervene |
| Cotton diplomacy | Failed |
| Stockpiles | Britain had reserves |
| Alternatives | Egypt, India supplied cotton |
| Moral factor | British public opposed slavery |

## Slavery's Profitability

### The Debate

| Position | Argument |
|----------|----------|
| Profitable (Fogel/Engerman) | Returns comparable to Northern industry |
| Unprofitable (older view) | Inefficient, would have died out |
| Current consensus | Highly profitable through 1860 |

### The Numbers

| Measure | Evidence |
|---------|----------|
| Slave prices | Rose continuously to 1860 |
| Return on investment | 8-10% annually |
| Productivity | Increased through coercion |
| Efficiency | Gang labor highly productive |

### Why It Wouldn't Have "Died Out"

| Factor | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| Profitability | Rising, not falling |
| Expansion | New lands still available |
| Prices | Slave prices at all-time high in 1860 |
| Demand | Global cotton demand growing |

## The Path to War

### Economic Tensions

| Issue | Conflict |
|-------|----------|
| Tariffs | South opposed, wanted free trade |
| Western lands | Free or slave? |

| Political power (3/5 clause) | Economic competition |
| Way of life | Moral opposition (some) |
