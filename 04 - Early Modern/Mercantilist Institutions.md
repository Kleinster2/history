# Mercantilist Institutions

Navigation Acts, tariffs, monopolies as deliberate institutional choices. Mercantilism was institutional design for national power—sometimes enabling, sometimes extractive, always intentional. European states in the early modern period didn't just let markets operate; they constructed trading systems to maximize national wealth and power. Understanding mercantilism reveals how states shaped economic institutions before the free trade era.

## Navigation Acts

### English Navigation System

| Act | Key Provisions |
|-----|----------------|
| 1651 | Colonial goods in English ships only |
| 1660 | "Enumerated goods" must go through England |
| 1663 | European goods to colonies via England |
| 1673 | Plantation duties on intercolonial trade |
| 1696 | Enforcement mechanisms, vice-admiralty courts |

### Economic Logic

| Goal | Mechanism |
|------|-----------|
| Shipping monopoly | Colonies must use English ships |
| Trade entrepôt | All goods flow through England |
| Revenue | Customs duties captured |
| Naval power | Merchant marine = naval reserve |
| Colonial dependence | Colonies tied to mother country |

### Effects

| Beneficiary | Gain |
|-------------|------|
| English merchants | Protected market |
| English shipping | Guaranteed cargo |
| English manufacturers | Colonial market |
| English customs | Revenue |

| Loser | Cost |
|-------|------|
| Colonial merchants | Higher transport costs |
| Colonial consumers | Limited sources |
| Efficient competitors | Excluded from trade |

## Colbertism

### French State-Directed Industry

| Policy | Implementation |
|--------|----------------|
| Manufactures royales | State-sponsored industries |
| Quality regulation | Standards for exports |
| Guild reform | Reorganization for control |
| Tariff protection | High duties on imports |
| Colonial monopoly | Exclusive French trade |

### Jean-Baptiste Colbert's System

| Element | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| Luxury goods | Export high-value manufactures |
| Gobelins tapestries | State workshop model |
| Mirror manufacture | Capture Venetian monopoly |
| Shipbuilding | Naval and commercial capacity |
| Canal construction | Internal trade infrastructure |

### Results

| Success | Limitation |
|---------|------------|
| Some industries developed | State direction inflexible |
| Quality reputation | Innovation stifled |
| Infrastructure built | Fiscal strain |
| Naval power | War costs overwhelmed |

## Bullionism

### Precious Metal Policies

| Policy | Rationale |
|--------|-----------|
| Export bans | Keep gold/silver home |
| Import duties | Reduce outflow for imports |
| Colonial mining | Increase supply (Spain) |
| Trade balance | Export > Import = inflow |

### Spanish Experience

| Inflow | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| American silver | Massive imports |
| Price Revolution | Inflation across Europe |
| Dutch paradox | Low-bullion Dutch prospered |
| Spanish decline | Wealth ≠ development |

### Critique Emerging

| Thinker | Argument |
|---------|----------|
| Thomas Mun | Trade balance, not bullion stock |
| William Petty | Labor and land = real wealth |
| Dudley North | Free trade benefits all |
| Adam Smith | Wealth of nations ≠ gold pile |

## Colonial Monopolies

### Exclusive Trade Rights

| Colony Type | Metropolitan Monopoly |
|-------------|----------------------|
| Spanish America | Casa de Contratación, Seville |
| Portuguese Brazil | Crown contracts, companies |
| Dutch East Indies | VOC monopoly |
| French Caribbean | Exclusive company → free trade |
| English colonies | Navigation Acts system |

### How Monopolies Worked

| Element | Function |
|---------|----------|
| Single port | All trade through designated port |
| Licensed ships | Only approved vessels |
| Registered cargo | Everything documented |
| Prohibited goods | Colonial manufacturing restricted |
| Enforcement | Penalties for smuggling |

### Reality vs. System

| Official Rule | Actual Practice |
|---------------|-----------------|
| Monopoly ports | Massive smuggling |
| Exclusive trade | Contraband everywhere |
| Metropolitan manufactures | Colonial production |
| Closed system | Porous enforcement |

## Evaluation: Did Mercantilism Work?

### Arguments For

| Benefit | Evidence |
|---------|----------|
| Protected infant industries | Some developed |
| Built naval power | England, Netherlands |
| Extracted colonial resources | Revenue and raw materials |
| Created trading infrastructure | Ports, ships, institutions |

### Arguments Against

| Cost | Evidence |
|------|----------|
| Inefficiency | Resources misallocated |
| Rent-seeking | Monopolies extracted, didn't produce |
| Colonial resentment | American Revolution |
| Restricted innovation | Protected incumbents |
| War | Competition over monopolies |

### Comparative Assessment

| Country | Mercantilist Success? |
|---------|----------------------|
| England | Yes (eventually liberalized) |
| Netherlands | Less mercantilist, prospered |
| France | Mixed (industries but fiscal strain) |
| Spain | No (silver ≠ development) |
| Portugal | Limited (Brazilian gold depleted) |

## The Institutional Choice

### Why Mercantilism?

| Factor | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| Zero-sum thinking | One nation's gain = another's loss |
| State-building | Trade policy = state power |
| Interest groups | Merchants sought protection |
| Fiscal need | Customs = state revenue |
| War | Economic policy as warfare |

### When Did It End?

| Development | Effect |
|-------------|--------|
| Smith's *Wealth of Nations* (1776) | Intellectual challenge |
| American Revolution (1776) | Colonial system failure |
| Corn Laws repeal (1846) | British free trade |
| Most-Favored Nation treaties | Spread liberalization |

### What Persisted

| Mercantilist Legacy | Modern Form |
|--------------------|-------------|
| Infant industry protection | Industrial policy |
| Strategic sectors | National security exceptions |
| Trade agreements | Negotiated access |
| Customs administration | Border enforcement |
| Revenue tariffs | Some remain |

## The Deeper Point

Mercantilism was institutional design for national power—sometimes enabling, sometimes extractive, always intentional. The [[British Empire Economy|Navigation Acts]] built English shipping dominance and provided a framework for colonial trade. French Colbertism created quality manufactures and infrastructure. But mercantilism also created rent-seeking monopolies, restricted innovation, and provoked colonial rebellion. The debate between protection and free trade—between [[State Capacity|state direction]] and [[Institutions and Progress|market freedom]]—began here. What mercantilism reveals is that economic institutions are never natural or automatic. Early modern states deliberately constructed trading systems, chose winners and losers, and shaped incentives. The transition to free trade wasn't the absence of policy but a different policy—one that Adam Smith argued would benefit all nations, not just protected interests. [[Development Economics|Development policy]] debates today echo these 300-year-old arguments: should states protect infant industries or let markets allocate resources? Mercantilism was the first systematic answer; the debate continues.
