# Ottoman Economic Institutions

The Ottoman Empire was wealthy, militarily powerful, and commercially sophisticated—yet its institutions channeled ambition toward military service and administration rather than commerce. The timar system tied land to military obligation. Tax farming extracted revenue without investing in development. Guilds (esnaf) controlled crafts under state supervision. Merchants—often minorities—prospered at the state's pleasure. The Ottoman example shows that wealth and power don't guarantee development: institutions that channel ambition into extraction rather than production can persist for centuries.

## Overview

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Duration | ~1300-1922 |
| Peak | 16th century |
| Economy | Agrarian, commercial |
| Institutions | Military-administrative |
| Trajectory | Gradual relative decline |

## The Timar System

### Structure

| Feature | Character |
|---------|-----------|
| Timar | Land grant for military service |
| Sipahi | Cavalryman receiving timar |
| Revenue | Collected from peasants |
| Obligation | Military duty when called |
| Non-hereditary | In theory, often became hereditary |

### Economic Effects

| Effect | Mechanism |
|--------|-----------|
| Extraction | Revenue for military, not investment |
| Peasant incentives | Limited, since not owners |
| Land improvement | Not incentivized |
| Comparison | Similar to European feudalism but different |

### Decline of System

| Period | Development |
|--------|-------------|
| 16th century | System peaked |
| 17th century | Breakdown begins |
| 18th century | Tax farming dominates |
| 19th century | Reform attempts |

## Tax Farming

### How It Worked

| Step | Process |
|------|---------|
| Auction | Revenue rights sold |
| Collection | Tax farmer extracts |
| Profit | Difference between collection and payment |
| Term | Initially short, became long |

### Economic Effects

| Effect | Consequence |
|--------|-------------|
| Short-term extraction | Maximize immediate revenue |
| No investment | Why improve what you'll lose? |
| Peasant squeeze | Over-extraction |
| Local power | Tax farmers accumulated |

### Comparison

| Ottoman | European |
|---------|----------|
| Tax farming | Also used, but less |
| State capacity | Couldn't collect directly |
| Merchants | Subordinate |
| Outcome | Extractive equilibrium |

## Guilds (Esnaf)

### Structure

| Feature | Character |
|---------|-----------|
| Organization | By trade |
| Regulation | State-supervised |
| Prices | Controlled |
| Quality | Standards |
| Entry | Restricted |

### State Control

| Mechanism | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| Oversight | State monitored |
| Price fixing | Social stability |
| Provisioning | Ensure urban supply |
| Taxation | Revenue extraction |

### Compared to European Guilds

| Ottoman | European |
|---------|----------|
| State-dominated | Some autonomous |
| Social stability | Economic function primary |
| Conservative | Variable |
| Decline | Similar timing |

## Merchants and Minorities

### Who Traded

| Group | Role |
|-------|------|
| Greeks | Commerce, shipping |
| Armenians | Long-distance trade |
| Jews | Finance, trade |
| Muslim merchants | Existed but often limited |

### Dhimmi Status

| Feature | Character |
|---------|-----------|
| Legal status | Protected but subordinate |
| Taxes | Special taxes (jizya) |
| Restrictions | Some occupations, dress |
| Tolerance | More than medieval Europe |
| Commercial advantage | Network effects |

### Limits

| Constraint | Effect |
|------------|--------|
| Political subordination | Couldn't influence policy |
| Expropriation risk | Wealth at sultan's pleasure |
| No political power | Unlike European communes |
| Specialization | Into commerce because excluded elsewhere |

## Why No Transformation?

### Institutional Factors

| Feature | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| Sultan's power | No constitutional limits |
| Military priority | Resources to army |
| Extraction | Not investment |
| Merchants subordinate | Couldn't shape institutions |
| [[Comparative Medieval Institutions\|No communes]] | No merchant self-governance |

### Comparison to Europe

| Ottoman | European |
|---------|----------|
| Centralized | Fragmented |
| Merchants subordinate | Merchants powerful (some places) |
| Military state | Commercial states emerged |
| Stable but static | Dynamic but unstable |

### Attempted Reforms

| Period | Reform |
|--------|--------|
| Tanzimat (1839-76) | Legal, administrative modernization |
| Young Turks (1908) | Constitutional reform |
| Outcome | Too late, too incomplete |

## The Deeper Point

The Ottoman Empire demonstrates that wealth and power don't guarantee [[Development Economics|development]]. At its peak, the Ottoman state controlled vast territories, maintained formidable military power, and presided over prosperous trade routes. But [[Institutions and Progress|institutions]] channeled ambition toward military service and state office, not commerce and production. The timar system extracted revenue for military maintenance, not agricultural investment. Tax farming prioritized short-term extraction over long-term development. Guilds served social stability and state revenue, not innovation. Merchants—often religious minorities—prospered commercially but couldn't translate wealth into political power. There were no Ottoman [[Comparative Medieval Institutions|communes]] where merchants governed themselves. The contrast with [[Dutch Golden Age Model|Dutch]] or even [[Venetian Merchant Capitalism|Venetian]] institutions is stark: those were merchant republics where commerce shaped politics; the Ottoman Empire was a military state where commerce served the state. The result was an extractive equilibrium that could persist for centuries—prosperous enough to survive, but not dynamic enough to transform. When European industrialization shifted the global balance, Ottoman institutions couldn't adapt. The empire that had terrified Europe became the "sick man" precisely because its institutions, designed for military extraction, couldn't generate industrial growth.
