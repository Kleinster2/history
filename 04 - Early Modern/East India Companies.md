# East India Companies

The East India Companies were the most powerful corporations in history—chartered monopolies that conquered continents, ruled millions, and pioneered the corporate form. The Dutch VOC and English EIC transformed the Asian trade, accumulated unprecedented wealth, and ultimately became states unto themselves. They were capitalism's first global enterprises.
