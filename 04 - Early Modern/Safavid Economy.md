# Safavid Economy

Persia between Ottomans and Mughals. The Safavid Empire (1501-1736) built a commercial state around silk exports, Armenian merchant networks, and the stunning capital of Isfahan. Religious identity shaped economic relations as Shi'a Persia navigated between Sunni rivals and Christian trading partners.

## The Deeper Point

The Safavid economy shows how [[Institutions and Progress|institutional arrangements]] could channel religious difference into commercial advantage. By using Armenian Christians as intermediaries, Shah Abbas connected Shi'a Persia to Christian Europe without compromising religious identity. The Armenians became the trusted bridge between civilizations.

The silk monopoly reveals the fiscal-commercial nexus of early modern states. The shah needed revenue; silk provided it. But monopoly control also limited entrepreneurial development. When the state collapsed, so did the trade system it controlled.

The rivalry with the Ottomans shaped economic geography. Unable to trade easily overland through Ottoman territory, Persia developed alternative routes—through Russia, through the Persian Gulf, through Armenian networks that bypassed Sunni lands. Geopolitics determined trade routes.

Isfahan's splendor represented both achievement and vulnerability. The magnificent capital showcased Safavid wealth and attracted trade. But concentration also created fragility. When the Afghans took Isfahan, they destroyed not just a city but a commercial system.

The Armenian diaspora's subsequent history demonstrates institutional resilience. When Safavid Persia collapsed, Armenian merchants adapted, shifting to new routes and partners. The community-based trust networks survived the fall of the empire that had fostered them—proving more durable than state institutions.
