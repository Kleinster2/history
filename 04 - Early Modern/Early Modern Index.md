# Early Modern History (1500-1800)

The Early Modern period witnessed the creation of a truly global economy for the first time—and the Great Divergence that would make Europe dominant. Atlantic trade, colonialism, the slave trade, and eventually the Industrial Revolution transformed economic relationships worldwide, ending the rough parity between civilizations that had characterized earlier eras.
