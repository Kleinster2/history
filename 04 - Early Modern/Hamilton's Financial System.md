# Hamilton's Financial System

Alexander Hamilton, as the first Secretary of the Treasury, created American capitalism in a few decisive years. Facing a bankrupt nation with worthless currency and crushing debt, he built a financial system that established national credit, created a banking system, and set the United States on a path to industrialization. His program remains one of history's most successful exercises in financial state-building.

## Overview

### The Problem

| Factor | 1789 Reality |
|--------|--------------|
| Foreign debt | ~$12 million (to France, Netherlands, Spain) |
| Domestic debt | ~$42 million (bonds, certificates) |
| State debts | ~$25 million |
| Currency | No national money |
| Credit | None—US couldn't borrow |

### Hamilton's Solution

| Report | Proposal |
|--------|----------|
| Report on Public Credit (1790) | Fund debt at par, assume state debts |
| Report on a National Bank (1790) | Create Bank of the United States |
| Report on Manufactures (1791) | Tariffs, subsidies for industry |

---

## Funding and Assumption

### The Debt Problem

| Debt Type | Issue |
|-----------|-------|
| Foreign | Must be paid to maintain credit |
| Domestic | Traded at 20-25 cents on dollar |
| State | Uneven—some states had paid, others hadn't |

### Hamilton's Proposal

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Fund at par | Pay face value, not market value |
| New bonds | Exchange old debt for new federal bonds |
| Assumption | Federal government takes state debts |
| Revenue | Tariffs and excise taxes |

### The Controversy

| Critics Said | Hamilton Said |
|--------------|---------------|
| Speculators bought debt cheap, will profit | Credit requires honoring obligations |
| Original holders sold in desperation | Can't trace original holders |
| Virginia paid its debts, why assume others? | National unity requires shared burden |
| Enriches the few | Creditor class will support government |

### The Compromise of 1790

| Party | Got |
|-------|-----|
| Hamilton | Assumption of state debts |
| Jefferson/Madison | Capital on Potomac (Washington, D.C.) |
| Result | Dinner deal brokered |

## The National Bank

### Bank of the United States (1791)

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Capital | $10 million (largest US corporation) |
| Ownership | 20% government, 80% private |
| Charter | 20 years |
| Functions | Hold deposits, issue notes, make loans |

### Why a Bank?

| Need | Bank Solution |
|------|---------------|
| Currency | Bank notes circulate as money |
| Credit | Loans to government and business |
| Fiscal agent | Collects taxes, pays bills |
| Stability | Manages other banks' notes |

### The Constitutional Debate

| Hamilton | Jefferson |
|----------|-----------|
| Implied powers | Strict construction |
| "Necessary and proper" clause | Not enumerated, not allowed |
| Bank is convenient means | Dangerous precedent |
| Washington agreed | Lost this round |

### The Bank's Impact

| Effect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Currency | Bank notes widely accepted |
| Credit | US could borrow at 6% (vs. couldn't borrow) |
| Commerce | Facilitated trade |
| Model | State banks proliferated |

## The Revenue System

### Tariffs

| Rate | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| ~5-15% | Revenue (primary) |
| Higher on some goods | Protection (secondary) |
| Tonnage duties | Favor American ships |

### The Whiskey Tax (1791)

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Rate | 25% on spirits |
| Target | Western farmers (grain → whiskey) |
| Rationale | Revenue, also discourage drinking |
| Result | [[Whiskey Rebellion]] (1794) |

### Revenue Results

| Year | Federal Revenue |
|------|-----------------|
| 1792 | $3.7 million |
| 1795 | $6.1 million |
| 1800 | $10.8 million |
| Source | ~90% from tariffs |

## Report on Manufactures

### Hamilton's Vision

| Element | Proposal |
|---------|----------|
| Tariffs | Protect infant industries |
| Subsidies | "Bounties" for key sectors |
| Infrastructure | Roads, canals |
| Immigration | Attract skilled workers |

### Key Arguments

| Point | Reasoning |
|-------|-----------|
| Agriculture alone insufficient | Nations need diverse economies |
| Manufacturing creates wealth | Adds value, employs labor |
| Infant industry protection | New industries need shelter |
| National security | Can't depend on imports for war |

### Reception

| Outcome | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Congress | Did not adopt most proposals |
| Tariffs | Modest protection only |
| Subsidies | Not enacted |
| Legacy | Influenced later policy (Clay's American System) |

---

## The Results

### Credit Established

| Indicator | Before | After |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| US bonds | Worthless/huge discount | Near par |
| Borrowing cost | Couldn't borrow | 6% |
| Foreign investment | None | Flowed in |
| International standing | Deadbeat | Creditworthy |

### Economic Growth

| Factor | Change |
|--------|--------|
| Bank credit | Expanded commerce |
| Stable currency | Facilitated trade |
| Investment | Foreign capital entered |
| Speculation | Land, banks, infrastructure |

### The Panic of 1792

| Method | Treasury bought securities |
| Result | Panic contained |
| Legacy | Central bank function demonstrated |

|-----------|------------------|
| Favors speculators | Stable creditor class supports government |
| Creates aristocracy | Commercial republic, not agrarian fantasy |
| Corruption | Interest aligns wealth with state |
| Too British | British system works |

### What Happened After

|-------|------|--------|
| Bank charter expires | 1811 | Not renewed (Jeffersonians) |
| War of 1812 | 1812-1815 | Financial chaos without bank |
| Second Bank | 1816 | Recreated Hamiltonian system |
| Jackson kills it | 1836 | Another experiment in no central bank |
| Panics | 1837, 1857, 1873, 1893, 1907 | Instability without central bank |
| Federal Reserve | 1913 | Hamilton's vision finally permanent |

### The Hamiltonian Legacy
