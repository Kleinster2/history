# Steam Engine

The steam engine was the pivotal technology of the Industrial Revolution—the machine that converted coal into motion and freed humanity from dependence on muscle, water, and wind. Its development from crude mine pump to universal power source took over a century and depended on a specific conjunction of need (flooded coal mines), resources (cheap coal), and skills (British metalworkers).

## Overview

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| First practical engine | 1712 (Newcomen) |
| Key improvement | 1769 (Watt's separate condenser) |
| High pressure | 1800+ (Trevithick) |
| Peak use | 19th century |
| Superseded by | Electric motors, internal combustion |

## The Problem: Flooded Mines

### Why Steam Was Needed

| Situation | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| [[Timber Crisis]] | Wood scarce, coal needed |
| Coal demand | Rising for fuel |
| Deeper mines | Followed seams down |
| Water table | Mines flooded |
| Horse pumps | Expensive, limited |

### The Vicious Circle

```
Need more coal
      ↓
Dig deeper mines
      ↓
More flooding
      ↓
Need pumps
      ↓
Pumps need power
      ↓
→ Steam engine solves this
```

**The steam engine was invented to get more coal—which it then consumed.**

| Device | "Miner's Friend" |
| Principle | Steam vacuum sucks water |
| Problem | Limited lift (~30 feet) |
| Problem | High pressure, explosions |
| Problem | Inefficient |
| Result | Rarely used in mines |

### Denis Papin (1690)

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Contribution | Piston-and-cylinder concept |
| Problem | Never practical engine |
| Legacy | Influenced Newcomen |

## Newcomen Engine (1712)

### The Breakthrough

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Inventor | Thomas Newcomen |
| Date | 1712 (Dudley Castle) |
| Type | Atmospheric engine |
| Use | Mine pumping |
| Success | Actually worked |

### How It Worked

| Step | Process |
|------|---------|
| 1 | Steam fills cylinder |
| 2 | Cold water injected |
| 3 | Steam condenses |
| 4 | Vacuum created |
| 5 | Atmospheric pressure pushes piston down |
| 6 | Piston connected to pump rod |
| 7 | Repeat |

### Characteristics

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Efficiency | ~1% (very low) |
| Fuel use | Enormous |
| Power | ~5 horsepower |
| Speed | ~12 strokes/minute |
| Size | Huge |
| Location | Only viable at coal mines (cheap fuel) |

### Impact

| Effect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Deeper mining | Could pump from depth |
| Coal output | Increased |
| Spread | Hundreds built by 1760s |
| Limitation | Too inefficient for non-coal sites |

| Horsepower unit | 1783 | Marketing metric |

### From Pump to Power Source

| Before Watt | After Watt |
|-------------|------------|
| Reciprocating only | Rotary motion |
| Mine pumping only | Any machinery |
| At coal mines only | Anywhere (more efficient) |
| Fixed | Still fixed, but versatile |
