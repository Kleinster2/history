# Proto-Industrial Regions

Where and why did putting-out concentrate? Proto-industrial regions had institutional preconditions—labor flexibility, merchant capital, market access—that determined where factories emerged. Lancashire, Flanders, the Rhineland, Gujarat, Jiangnan: these regions developed dense rural manufacturing centuries before factories. Understanding why proto-industry concentrated where it did illuminates why industrialization happened where it happened.

## British Regions

### Lancashire

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Product | Cotton textiles (from 1600s), wool |
| Organization | Putting-out, then factories |
| Labor | Rural families, then factory workers |
| Geography | Access to Liverpool port, coal |
| Transition | First to factory production |

### Why Lancashire?

| Factor | Contribution |
|--------|--------------|
| Weak guilds | Less restriction on innovation |
| Coal | Energy for later mechanization |
| Liverpool | Atlantic trade, cotton imports |
| Labor supply | Rural population available |
| Merchant capital | Commercial expertise |

### Yorkshire

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Product | Woolen cloth |
| Organization | Independent clothiers, merchants |
| Labor | Family production units |
| Geography | Pennine sheep, water power |
| Character | More artisanal than Lancashire |

## Continental Europe

### Flanders

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Product | Linen, wool textiles |
| Organization | Dense rural manufacturing |
| Labor | Farm families, part-time |
| Markets | European wide |
| History | Medieval origins |

### Rhineland

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Product | Linens, metal goods |
| Organization | Putting-out networks |
| Labor | Rural households |
| Geography | Rhine river trade |
| States | Fragmented political control |

### Switzerland

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Product | Watches, textiles |
| Organization | Decentralized production |
| Labor | Mountain villages |
| Skills | High precision, education |
| Neutrality | War avoided disruption |

## Asian Proto-Industry

### Indian Textiles

| Region | Specialization |
|--------|----------------|
| Gujarat | Cotton, calicoes |
| Bengal | Fine muslins |
| Coromandel | Chintz, prints |
| Organization | Weaver communities, merchant capital |
| Scale | Largest textile producer globally |

### Why India?

| Factor | Contribution |
|--------|--------------|
| Cotton | Indigenous crop, long cultivation |
| Skills | Hereditary weaving castes |
| Demand | Domestic and export markets |
| Merchants | Indian and European capital |
| Cheap labor | Low wages enabled competition |

### Chinese Silk (Jiangnan)

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Region | Yangtze delta |
| Product | Silk, cotton |
| Organization | Household production, merchant coordination |
| Labor | Farm families |
| Markets | Domestic, Southeast Asia, Europe |

### Why Jiangnan?

| Factor | Contribution |
|--------|--------------|
| Density | High population concentration |
| Transport | Canal system |
| Skills | Mulberry cultivation, weaving tradition |
| Capital | Merchants, landlords |
| Markets | Huge domestic demand |

## Why Proto-Industry Here?

### Common Conditions

| Factor | Requirement |
|--------|-------------|
| Labor surplus | Underemployed rural population |
| Merchant capital | Financing for materials, marketing |
| Market access | Transportation to buyers |
| Skills | Traditional craft knowledge |
| Flexibility | Weak guild/state restrictions |

### Institutional Preconditions

| Institution | Function |
|-------------|----------|
| Weak guilds | Allowed rural production |
| Property rights | Merchants could contract |
| Transport | Roads, rivers, canals |
| Markets | Domestic and/or export |
| Credit | Financing for merchants |

## Which Became Factory Regions?

### Successful Transitions

| Region | Outcome |
|--------|---------|
| Lancashire | First factory district |
| Yorkshire | Mechanized wool |
| New England | American textiles |
| Belgium | Continental industrialization |

### Failed Transitions

| Region | Outcome |
|--------|---------|
| India | Deindustrialized under British rule |
| Flanders | Overtaken by Belgium |
| Many German regions | Some industrialized, some not |
| China | Delayed until 20th century |

### What Determined Transition?

| Factor | Enabled Factories | Blocked Factories |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Coal | Available, cheap | Absent, expensive |
| Institutions | Property, contract, banks | Restrictions, instability |
| Markets | Protected, accessible | Competition, distance |
| Labor | Mobile, trainable | Bound, resistant |
| Capital | Available | Constrained |

## Indian Deindustrialization

### The Process

| Phase | Development |
|-------|-------------|
| Pre-1750 | World's largest textile producer |
| 1750-1813 | EIC increasingly controls |
| 1813+ | Free trade opens India |
| 1820s+ | British textiles flood market |
| 1850s+ | Indian industry decimated |

### How It Happened

| Mechanism | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| Colonial policy | India as raw material supplier |
| Machine competition | British cheaper |
| Tariffs | India open, Britain protected |
| Railroads | British goods reached interior |
| Credit collapse | Traditional merchants marginalized |

### Alternative Explanation

| Factor | Argument |
|--------|----------|
| Technology | Machines simply more productive |
| Wages | Indian low wages couldn't compete |
| Capital | Britain could invest more |
| Institutions | Britain's enabled growth |

## The Deeper Point

Proto-industrial regions had institutional preconditions—labor flexibility, merchant capital, market access—that determined where factories emerged. [[Proto-industrialization|Putting-out systems]] developed in Lancashire, Flanders, Gujarat, and Jiangnan because these regions had the right combination: surplus labor, commercial infrastructure, skills, and freedom from guild restrictions. But proto-industry wasn't the same as industry. The transition to factories required additional conditions: energy (coal), capital, stable institutions, and markets. Lancashire had all of these; India had proto-industry but [[Mughal India Economy|lost it to British competition]]. The comparison reveals that proto-industrialization was necessary but not sufficient for industrialization. Regions with proto-industry were candidates for factories, but [[Institutions and Progress|institutional factors]]—colonial rule, state capacity, property rights, energy access—determined which candidates succeeded. The [[Industrial Revolution|Industrial Revolution]] didn't emerge from nowhere; it built on centuries of rural manufacturing that had developed the skills, capital, and commercial networks that factories would eventually absorb.
