# The Timber Crisis

Britain's 17th-century timber crisis was a pivotal moment in economic history—a resource constraint that pushed the economy toward coal, accidentally setting the stage for the Industrial Revolution. What looked like decline was actually the beginning of the energy transition that would transform the world.

## Overview

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Period | ~1550-1700 |
| Location | Britain (primarily), parts of Europe |
| Problem | Wood scarcity, rising prices |
| Solution | Coal substitution |
| Consequence | Path to industrialization |

---

## The Problem

### Wood's Role in Pre-Industrial Economy

| Use | Application |
|-----|-------------|
| Fuel | Heating, cooking |
| Charcoal | Iron smelting |
| Construction | Buildings, ships |
| Industry | Glass, brewing, salt, soap |
| Agriculture | Fencing, tools |

**Wood was the universal material—energy source and raw material.**

### Rising Demand

| Driver | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Population growth | More fuel needed |
| Urbanization | London growing rapidly |
| Naval expansion | Shipbuilding demand |
| Iron industry | Charcoal for smelting |
| Glass, brewing | Industrial fuel |
| Construction | Building boom |

### London's Appetite

| Period | London Population |
|--------|-------------------|
| 1500 | ~50,000 |
| 1600 | ~200,000 |
| 1700 | ~575,000 |

Each person needed fuel for heating, cooking. The city consumed forests.

## Evidence of Crisis

### Price Indicators

| Period | Timber Prices |
|--------|---------------|
| 1500-1550 | Baseline |
| 1550-1600 | Rising |
| 1600-1650 | Sharp increase |
| 1650-1700 | Very high |

Timber prices rose faster than general inflation.

### Contemporary Accounts

| Observer | Concern |
|----------|---------|
| John Evelyn (1664) | *Sylva* - warned of deforestation |
| Government reports | Naval timber shortages |
| Industrial complaints | Fuel costs rising |

### Deforestation

| Region | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Southeast England | Heavily depleted |
| Weald (iron region) | Stripped for charcoal |
| Around London | Cleared |
| Scotland, Wales | Still forested (distant) |

---

## The Debate: Real Crisis or Myth?

### The "Crisis" View

| Argument | Evidence |
|----------|----------|
| Prices rose | Documentary evidence |
| Forests shrank | Landscape changes |
| Contemporaries worried | Evelyn, others |
| Coal adoption | Why switch if wood plentiful? |

### The "Myth" View (Revisionist)

| Argument | Evidence |
|----------|----------|
| Some exaggeration | Evelyn had agenda |
| Regional variation | Not universal |
| Adaptation | Coppicing, imports |
| Coal cheaper anyway | Economic choice |

### Synthesis

| Assessment | Explanation |
|------------|-------------|
| Real constraints | Prices did rise |
| Not absolute scarcity | Wood available, just costly |
| Economic pressure | Pushed toward alternatives |
| Regional | Worst near cities, industry |

**The crisis was real enough to change behavior—which is what matters.**

## The Coal Solution

### Why Coal?

| Factor | Advantage |
|--------|-----------|
| Abundant | Britain had lots |
| Accessible | Near surface, near coasts |
| Energy-dense | More heat per weight |
| Cheaper | As wood prices rose |

### The Transition

| Use | Wood → Coal |
|-----|-------------|
| Domestic heating | Early adoption |
| Brewing | Adapted process |
| Glass-making | Shifted to coal |
| Salt production | Coal-fired |
| Brick-making | Coal-fired |
| Iron (later) | Coke (from 1709) |

### Obstacles to Coal

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Smoke/smell | Chimneys, acceptance |
| Different properties | Process adaptation |
| Mining depth | Pumps (→ steam engine) |
| Transport | Coastal shipping, canals |

---

## The Chain of Consequences

### From Timber Crisis to Industrial Revolution

```
Timber scarcity
      ↓
Coal adoption
      ↓
Deeper mines needed
      ↓
Flooding problem
      ↓
Steam pump (Newcomen, 1712)
      ↓
Steam engine improvements (Watt)
      ↓
Factory power
      ↓
Industrial Revolution
```

### The Wrigley Thesis

| Argument | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Organic economy | Limited by land (wood, food, fiber) |
| Mineral economy | Freed from land constraints |
| Coal as breakthrough | Stored solar energy (fossil) |
| Britain's advantage | Coal + crisis = transition |

---

## Comparison with Other Regions

### Why Britain, Not Others?

| Region | Situation |
|--------|-----------|
| Britain | Timber crisis + accessible coal |
| Netherlands | Peat, then coal imports |
| France | More forest, less pressure |
| Germany | More forest |
| China | Coal far from population |
| Japan | Forests managed, less crisis |

### The Counterfactual

| Question | Consideration |
|----------|---------------|
| Without crisis? | Less pressure to switch |
| Without coal? | Crisis harder to solve |
| Different location? | Might not have industrialized |

---

## Environmental Perspective

### Short-term Impact

| Effect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Deforestation | Landscape transformed |
| Soil erosion | Some areas |
| Wildlife loss | Habitat destruction |
| Air quality | Coal smoke (worse?) |

### Long-term Impact

| Effect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Forest recovery | Once pressure removed |
| Coal pollution | New problems |
| CO2 emissions | Climate change begins |
| Path dependence | Fossil fuel economy |

### The Irony

| Short-term | Long-term |
|------------|-----------|
| Saved the forests | Started climate change |
| Solved local problem | Created global problem |
| Sustainable-seeming | Unsustainable |

---

## The Shipbuilding Dimension

### Naval Timber

| Need | Species |
|------|---------|
| Hulls | Oak (large, curved) |
| Masts | Pine/fir (tall, straight) |
| Deck | Various |

### The Strategic Problem

| Issue | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Navy crucial | National security |
| Oak takes centuries | Can't quickly grow |
| Masts imported | Baltic dependency |
| Competition | Other navies, merchant ships |

### Solutions Attempted

| Solution | Result |
|----------|--------|
| Forest reserves | Royal forests protected |
| Baltic imports | Dependency |
| Colonial timber | North American source |
| Iron ships (later) | Eventually replaced wood |

---

## Legacy

### For Energy History

| Lesson | Implication |
|--------|-------------|
| Resource constraints | Drive innovation |
| Substitution | Possible under pressure |
| Path dependence | Early choices matter |
| Transitions | Take decades |

### For Understanding Industrialization

| Factor | Role |
|--------|------|
| Timber crisis | Created pressure |
| Coal availability | Enabled solution |
| Geography | Britain's advantage |
| Contingency | Could have been different |

### For Today

| Historical | Contemporary |
|------------|--------------|
| Wood scarcity | Fossil fuel limits |
| Coal transition | Renewable transition |
| Decades-long | Also decades-long |
| Economic drivers | Also economic drivers |
