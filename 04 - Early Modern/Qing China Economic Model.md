# Qing China Economic Model

Qing China was the world's largest economy—more populous than Europe, with intensive agriculture, extensive internal trade, and sophisticated commercial practices. Yet China didn't industrialize. The Pomeranz "Great Divergence" thesis asks why: were European advantages decisive, or was China on a similar path until contingent factors (coal location, colonies) tipped the balance? The institutional perspective adds another dimension: Chinese merchants remained subordinate to scholar-officials, channeling ambition into examination success rather than commercial innovation. Multiple factors mattered, but institutions shaped which factors could operate.

## Overview

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Period | 1644-1912 |
| Population | ~300 million (1800) |
| Economy | World's largest |
| Character | Agrarian + extensive commerce |
| Puzzle | Why no industrialization? |

## Agricultural System

### Intensive Farming

| Feature | Character |
|---------|-----------|
| Rice cultivation | High yields |
| Double cropping | Multiple harvests |
| Irrigation | Extensive systems |
| Labor intensive | Many workers per acre |
| Productivity | Among world's highest |

### Land Tenure

| Feature | Character |
|---------|-----------|
| Private ownership | More than Europe in some ways |
| Partible inheritance | Land divided among sons |
| Small holdings | Fragmentation over generations |
| Tenancy | Common |
| Markets | Active land markets |

### Malthusian Pressures

| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Population growth | 1700-1850 tripled |
| Land per capita | Declined |
| Involution | More labor, same output |
| Constraint | Approaching Malthusian limit |

## Commerce and Trade

### Internal Trade

| Feature | Scale |
|---------|-------|
| Long-distance | Grain, salt, tea, silk |
| Markets | Elaborate hierarchy |
| Networks | Regional merchant associations |
| Credit | Sophisticated instruments |

### Merchant Organization

| Form | Character |
|------|-----------|
| Native place associations | Shanxi, Huizhou |
| Guilds | Trade regulation |
| Credit networks | Interregional |
| Family firms | Dominant form |

### External Trade

| Period | Character |
|--------|-----------|
| Pre-1800 | Limited, controlled |
| Canton system | Europeans restricted |
| Silver imports | Paid for exports |
| Opium | Reversed flows, crisis |

## Institutional Framework

### Scholar-Officials

| Feature | Character |
|---------|-----------|
| Examination system | Merit-based selection |
| Prestige | Highest status |
| Path | For ambitious, smart men |
| Commerce | Lower status |
| Officials | Controlled economy |

### Merchant Status

| Reality | Implication |
|---------|-------------|
| Wealthy | Could accumulate |
| Low status | Officially demeaned |
| No political power | Subject to officials |
| Goal | Often: sons become scholars |
| Insecurity | Wealth could be taken |

### Comparison to Europe

| China | Europe |
|-------|--------|
| Unified empire | Fragmented states |
| Merchants subordinate | Some merchant power |
| Scholar-official path | Commerce respected (some places) |
| State controls | Some autonomous cities |

## The Great Divergence Debate

### Pomeranz Thesis

| Argument | Evidence |
|----------|----------|
| Core regions similar | Jiangnan ≈ England ~1750 |
| Coal location | Britain lucky, China's far from industry |
| Colonies | Provided land-intensive goods |
| Contingency | Not inevitable superiority |

### Institutional Response

| Counter-argument | Claim |
|------------------|-------|
| Institutions differed | Merchant power, property rights |
| State role | Chinese state constrained commerce |
| Science | European scientific revolution |
| Accumulation | Incentives for reinvestment |

### Multiple Factors

| Factor | Role |
|--------|------|
| Coal | Geography mattered |
| Colonies | Demand, raw materials |
| Institutions | Shaped incentives |
| Contingency | Many things had to align |

## Why China Didn't Industrialize

### Institutional Factors

| Feature | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| Merchant subordination | No commercial institutions |
| Official interference | Could block innovation |
| Examination system | Channeled ambition |
| No property rights | Against state claims |

### Economic Factors

| Feature | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| Cheap labor | No mechanization incentive |
| Distant coal | Transportation costs |
| Different constraints | Not same pressure as Britain |
| Involution | More labor instead |

### Technological

| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Inventions existed | But didn't develop industrially |
| No scientific revolution | Applied science limited |
| Tacit knowledge | Didn't systematize |
| Diffusion | Wasn't institutionalized |

## Decline and Crisis

### Opium Wars

| Event | Consequence |
|-------|-------------|
| 1839-42, 1856-60 | Military defeats |
| Treaty ports | Foreign enclaves |
| Unequal treaties | Imposed terms |
| Silver drain | Economic crisis |

### Internal Crisis

| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Taiping Rebellion | Massive devastation |
| Population pressure | Resources strained |
| State weakness | Couldn't reform |
| Fiscal crisis | Revenue inadequate |

## The Deeper Point

China's non-industrialization is the [[Great Divergence|Great Divergence's]] central puzzle. Pomeranz showed that Chinese core regions were comparable to European cores around 1750—the divergence came later and wasn't predetermined. But [[Institutions and Progress|institutional]] differences mattered for how societies responded to constraints. When Britain faced high wages and cheap coal, [[Innovation Economics|entrepreneurs]] mechanized; when China faced different constraints, the response was different. Critically, Chinese merchants—however wealthy—couldn't create institutions that secured their interests against state interference. The examination system channeled ambitious young men toward scholarship, not commerce. Successful merchants sought official status for their sons, not commercial innovation. There was no Chinese [[Comparative Medieval Institutions|Amsterdam]] or [[Venetian Merchant Capitalism|Venice]] where merchants ruled themselves. This doesn't mean China was "backward"—it was productive, commercial, and sophisticated. But its institutions channeled ambition in directions that didn't produce industrialization. Coal location and colonial markets mattered too, but institutions shaped which resources could be exploited. The Qing model was stable and prosperous but not transformative—productive but not progressive in the sense of sustaining cumulative technological change.
