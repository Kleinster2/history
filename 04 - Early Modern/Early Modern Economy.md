# Early Modern Economy

The early modern period (roughly 1500-1800) saw the first globalization of trade, the rise of capitalism, colonial empires, and the beginnings of modern economic institutions. European expansion created Atlantic economies based on sugar, slaves, and silver. Mercantilism guided policy while banking, joint-stock companies, and financial markets developed. This period laid foundations for the [[Industrial Revolution]] that would transform everything.
