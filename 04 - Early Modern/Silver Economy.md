# Silver Economy

American silver created the first truly global economy. The mines of Potosi and Mexico produced unprecedented wealth, connected Europe to Asia, caused the first global inflation, and transformed monetary systems everywhere. Silver was the blood of early modern commerce—and Spain, despite controlling the source, failed to convert this bonanza into lasting development.

## Overview

| Peak output | 1590s |
| Share of world silver | 85% from Americas |
| Where it went | 1/3 Europe, 1/3 stayed Americas, 1/3 Asia |

### Why Silver Mattered
