# Tokugawa Japan Economy

Tokugawa Japan presents a paradox: a deliberately isolated country that nonetheless developed a sophisticated market economy. For 250 years, Japan closed itself to most foreign contact—yet achieved remarkable economic growth, urbanization, and proto-industrialization. When forcibly opened in 1853, Japan could industrialize faster than any non-Western nation. The Tokugawa period shows that economic development doesn't require global integration, and that isolation can be a strategy, not just a constraint.
