# Westward Expansion

American westward expansion was the largest land transfer in modern history—a process that turned a coastal nation into a continental empire. Land policy shaped American economic development: cheap land drew immigrants, created a property-owning democracy, and fueled growth through speculation, agriculture, and resource extraction. It also dispossessed Indigenous peoples and extended slavery into new territories, setting the stage for civil war.
