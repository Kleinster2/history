# Atlantic Slave Trade

The Atlantic slave trade was history's largest forced migration—the transportation of 12-15 million Africans to the Americas over four centuries. This commerce in human beings fueled plantation economies producing sugar, cotton, and tobacco for global markets. The trade generated enormous profits, devastated African societies, and created the racial structures that shaped the Americas. Understanding the slave trade means confronting the violent foundations of Atlantic commerce.
