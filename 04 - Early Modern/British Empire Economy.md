# British Empire Economy

The British Empire became the largest in history—at its peak ruling a quarter of the world's land and people. Unlike Spain, Britain converted imperial wealth into industrial development, becoming the world's first industrial nation. The empire provided markets, raw materials, and capital that fueled British growth, while colonial economies were restructured to serve metropolitan needs. Understanding the British Empire is essential to understanding both the Industrial Revolution and global inequality.
