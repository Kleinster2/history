# British Agricultural Revolution

The prerequisite for industrialization. The agricultural revolution freed labor and capital for factories—but at the cost of displacing millions from the land.

## The Transformation

### Before and After

| Indicator | 1600 | 1850 |
|-----------|------|------|
| Agricultural workforce | 80% of population | 20% of population |
| Yields per acre | Low, medieval levels | Doubled or tripled |
| Land ownership | Open fields, common rights | Enclosed, private |
| Farming method | Subsistence, communal | Commercial, scientific |

### Key Innovations

| Innovation | Effect |
|------------|--------|
| Crop rotation | Four-course (turnips, barley, clover, wheat) eliminated fallow |
| Selective breeding | Larger animals, higher yields (Bakewell's sheep) |
| Seed drill | Jethro Tull's invention, more efficient planting |
| Improved plows | Iron plows, deeper tillage |
| Drainage | Wet lands brought into production |
| Fertilization | Marl, lime, manure application |

## The Enclosure Movement

### What Enclosure Did

| Before Enclosure | After Enclosure |
|------------------|-----------------|
| Open fields, strip farming | Consolidated holdings |
| Common lands (grazing, wood) | Private property |
| Communal decisions | Individual management |
| Subsistence rights | Market orientation |

### Timeline

| Period | Character |
|--------|-----------|
| Tudor enclosure | Wool demand, limited scale |
| 1750-1830 | Parliamentary enclosure boom |
| 4,000+ Acts | Over 6 million acres enclosed |

### Who Gained, Who Lost

| Winners | Losers |
|---------|--------|
| Large landowners | Smallholders |
| Improving farmers | Cottagers with common rights |
| Agricultural laborers (initially) | Rural poor |
| Capital accumulation | Traditional communities |

## Agricultural Improvers

### Key Figures

| Innovator | Contribution |
|-----------|--------------|
| Jethro Tull (1674-1741) | Seed drill, horse-drawn hoe |
| Charles "Turnip" Townshend (1674-1738) | Four-course rotation |
| Robert Bakewell (1725-1795) | Selective livestock breeding |
| Thomas Coke (1754-1842) | Estate improvement, tenant education |
| Arthur Young (1741-1820) | Agricultural journalism, spread of knowledge |

### Improvement Networks

| Institution | Role |
|-------------|------|
| Board of Agriculture (1793) | Government promotion |
| Agricultural societies | Local experimentation |
| Journals and tours | Knowledge diffusion |
| Model farms | Demonstration |

## Productivity Gains

### Yields

| Crop | 1300 Yield | 1800 Yield |
|------|------------|------------|
| Wheat | 8 bushels/acre | 20+ bushels/acre |
| Barley | Similar | Doubled |
| Livestock weight | Medieval standards | 2-3x heavier |

### Labor Productivity

| Effect | Mechanism |
|--------|-----------|
| Fewer workers per acre | Consolidation, mechanization |
| Higher output per worker | Better tools, methods |
| Surplus labor | Released to industry |
| Food surplus | Fed urban population |

## Capital Accumulation

### Where Capital Came From

| Source | Destination |
|--------|-------------|
| Land rents | Investment in improvement |
| Agricultural profits | Manufacturing, banking |
| Landlord savings | Canal, railway projects |
| Rising land values | Collateral for borrowing |

### Agricultural-Industrial Links

| Connection | Example |
|------------|---------|
| Labor | Displaced workers → factory labor |
| Capital | Agricultural profits → industrial investment |
| Demand | Farmers bought manufactures |
| Raw materials | Wool, leather, grain for processing |
| Infrastructure | Roads, canals for farm products |

## The Human Cost

### Displacement

| Effect | Scale |
|--------|-------|
| Common rights lost | Millions affected |
| Rural poverty | Increased |
| Vagrancy | Criminal problem |
| Migration | To towns, colonies |
| Poor rates | Rose sharply |

### Resistance

| Form | Response |
|------|----------|
| Anti-enclosure riots | Suppressed |
| Machine breaking | Later Luddism |
| Poaching | Criminalized |
| Poor Law | Workhouses |

### Contemporary Views

| Perspective | View |
|-------------|------|
| Improvers | Progress, efficiency, necessity |
| Critics | Theft of commons, destruction of communities |
| Economists | Trade-offs, aggregate benefit |
| Historians | Debate continues |

## Why Britain?

### Comparative Factors

| Factor | Britain | Elsewhere |
|--------|---------|-----------|
| Property rights | Secure, improving | Variable |
| Legal system | Parliament could enclose | Different mechanisms |
| Climate | Suitable for new crops | Varied |
| Markets | Accessible, growing | Less developed |
| Knowledge networks | Active, connected | Less systematic |

### The English Model

| Element | Significance |
|---------|--------------|
| Large estates | Economies of scale |
| Tenant farmers | Entrepreneurial, investing |
| Wage laborers | Flexible workforce |
| Market orientation | Profit motive |

## Connection to [[Industrial Revolution]]

### The Prerequisite

| Agricultural Revolution Provided | Industrial Revolution Required |
|---------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Labor surplus | Workers for factories |
| Food surplus | Feed urban population |
| Capital accumulation | Investment funds |
| Domestic demand | Market for manufactures |
| Raw materials | Wool, grain, leather |

### Timing

| Period | Development |
|--------|-------------|
| 1700-1750 | Agricultural improvement accelerates |
| 1760-1800 | Industrial takeoff begins |
| Relationship | Agricultural preceded, enabled industrial |

## The Deeper Point

The agricultural revolution was the first [[Industrial Revolution|industrial revolution]]—it freed labor and capital for factories, but at the cost of displacing millions. The same [[Property Rights|property rights transformation]] that enabled improvement (enclosure) also created the dispossessed workforce that factories required.

This wasn't inevitable or natural. It required specific [[Institutions and Progress|institutional innovations]]—parliamentary enclosure acts, secure property rights, enforcement against resistance. The efficiency gains were real: Britain fed a growing population while releasing workers to industry. But the human costs—communities destroyed, traditional rights erased, rural poverty deepened—were also real.

The agricultural revolution shows that [[Economic Transformation|economic transformation]] creates winners and losers. The aggregate gains were genuine. The distribution of those gains was a matter of institutional choice—and in Britain, the choices favored landowners and the emerging industrial economy over rural communities.
