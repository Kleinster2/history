# Qing Dynasty

The Qing Dynasty (1644-1912)—China's last imperial dynasty, founded by Manchu conquerors—ruled the largest Chinese empire and presided over both prosperity and crisis. Early Qing saw population growth and economic expansion; the 19th century brought Western imperialism, the Opium Wars, and internal rebellions that weakened the dynasty. The Qing experience illustrates Asia's encounter with Western industrialization and the challenges of late modernization.
