# Qing China Economy

The Qing dynasty ruled the world's largest economy for most of the early modern period. China in 1800 had roughly a quarter of global GDP, sophisticated markets, and advanced agriculture. Yet it did not industrialize. The Qing economy is central to the Great Divergence debate: Why did this prosperous, commercialized economy fall behind? The answer challenges simple explanations and reveals the contingency of industrial modernity.

## Overview

### The Qing Economy in Numbers

| Measure | Scale |
|---------|-------|
| Population (1800) | ~300 million |
| Share of world GDP | ~25-30% |
| Territory | Largest since Mongols |
| Duration | 1644-1912 |

### The Central Question

Why did the world's largest, most commercialized economy not industrialize first?

| Market | Both domestic and export |

### The Yangzi Delta

| Labor cost | Low | High |
| Land scarcity | Severe | Less |
| Incentive for machines | Low | High |

**This comparison is central to Pomeranz's Great Divergence thesis.**

## Why No Industrial Revolution?

### The Debate

| Theory | Argument |
|--------|----------|
| Institutional | Lack of property rights, weak state |
| Geographic | No coal near textile regions |
| Cultural | Anti-commerce values |
| Demographic | Cheap labor reduced machine incentive |
| Path dependency | Locked into intensive agriculture |

### Pomeranz's Argument

| Point | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Similarity | China and England were comparable c. 1750 |
| Divergence | Late, from 1800 |
| Key factors | Coal location + colonies |
| Not culture | Not inherent Chinese disadvantage |

### Resource Constraints

| Resource | China | England |
|----------|-------|---------|
| Coal | Far from textile centers | Near Manchester |
| Wood | Depleted | Colonies provided |
| Land | Extremely scarce | Colonies expanded |

### State and Institutions

| Factor | Qing China | England |
|--------|------------|---------|
| Property rights | Existed, enforced | Strong |
| Patent system | None | Encouraged innovation |
| State support | Not for industry | Some support |
| Legal system | Different tradition | Common law |

## Silver and Money

### The Silver Problem

| Period | Situation |
|--------|-----------|
| 1570s-1800 | Silver inflows (American) |
| 1820s-1840s | Silver outflows (opium) |
| Effect | Deflation, economic stress |
| Result | Contributed to Qing decline |

| Problem for West | Constant silver drain |
| Solution | Opium |

### The Opium Trade

## Late Qing Reforms

### Self-Strengthening Movement

| Initiative | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| Arsenals | Modern weapons |
| Shipyards | Naval power |

| Railroads | (Limited) |
| Result | Partial modernization |

## Historical Significance

### For the Great Divergence

| Question | China's Role |

| Why? | Geography, institutions, contingency |
| Inevitable? | No—China was comparable |

### For Economic History

|--------|-------------|
| Development not linear | Can fall behind |
| Geography matters | Coal location crucial |
| Contingency | Industrialization not inevitable |
| External shocks | Can derail development |

### For China Today

| Legacy | Contemporary Relevance |
|--------|----------------------|
| Century of humiliation | National memory |
| Catching up | Framing of modern development |
| State role | Debates about intervention |

## Comparison: 1800 vs. 1900

| Measure | 1800 | 1900 |
|---------|------|------|
| Share of world GDP | ~25-30% | ~5-10% |
| Relative position | World's largest | Falling behind |
| Population | 300 million | 400 million |
| Industrialization | Minimal | Beginning |
| Sovereignty | Full | Compromised |

**The 19th century was China's catastrophe—from world's largest economy to "sick man of Asia."**
