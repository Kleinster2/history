# Age of Exploration

The Age of Exploration (roughly 1400-1600)—when European navigators sailed to previously unknown (to them) lands—transformed global history. Portugal pioneered routes to Asia around Africa; Spain funded Columbus's westward voyage, reaching the Americas. These voyages created the first truly global trade networks, initiated the [[Columbian Exchange]], and began European colonial expansion. Economic motives—seeking Asian spices, gold, and trade routes—drove exploration.
