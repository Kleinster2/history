# The Lunar Society

The Lunar Society of Birmingham was an informal club of industrialists, scientists, and thinkers who met monthly around the full moon (for light to travel home by). This remarkable network—including Boulton, Watt, Wedgwood, Darwin, and Priestley—embodied the fusion of science, industry, and commerce that drove the Industrial Revolution. They were friends, business partners, and in-laws who changed the world.
