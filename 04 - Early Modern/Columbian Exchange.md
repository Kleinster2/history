# Columbian Exchange

The Columbian Exchange was the massive biological transfer between Old and New Worlds after 1492—the most transformative ecological event since the end of the Ice Age. Plants, animals, diseases, and peoples crossed the Atlantic in both directions, reshaping ecosystems and economies globally. Potatoes fed European population growth; European diseases devastated American populations; sugar created plantation slavery. This exchange shaped the modern world's demographics, diets, and economies.
