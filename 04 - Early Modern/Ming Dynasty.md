# Ming Dynasty

The Ming Dynasty (1368-1644)—founded after overthrowing Mongol rule—restored Chinese governance and presided over economic growth, population expansion, and cultural flourishing. Ming China was the world's largest economy, producing porcelain, silk, and tea for global markets while absorbing massive silver imports. The dynasty's decision to end oceanic exploration (Zheng He's voyages) and later maritime restrictions shaped global trade patterns.
