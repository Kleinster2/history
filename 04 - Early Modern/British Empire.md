# British Empire

The British Empire was history's largest empire—at its peak controlling a quarter of the world's land and population. From trading posts to settler colonies to industrial dominance, Britain shaped the modern global economy. British imperialism spread capitalism, law, language, and institutions worldwide while extracting resources and labor from colonized peoples. Understanding the British Empire means understanding both modern globalization and its violent origins.
