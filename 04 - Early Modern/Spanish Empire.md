# Spanish Empire

The Spanish Empire was the first global empire—spanning the Americas, Philippines, and parts of Europe and Africa for four centuries. Spanish conquests brought unprecedented silver flows that transformed the world economy. Yet Spain itself struggled to industrialize, losing its American colonies by the 1820s. The empire's history illustrates both the wealth and the distortions that colonial extraction could produce.
