# Spanish Empire Economy

The Spanish Empire was the first global empire—spanning the Americas, the Philippines, and parts of Europe. It controlled the greatest silver deposits ever discovered, yet Spain itself declined into relative poverty. The Spanish paradox haunts economic history: How could the richest empire become a byword for backwardness? The answer involves institutions, warfare, resource curses, and the structural problems of early modern imperialism.
