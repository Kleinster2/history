# The Knights Templar

The Templars began as poor knights protecting pilgrims to Jerusalem and ended as Europe's first international bank. Their story—from poverty to vast wealth to violent suppression—illustrates both the possibilities and dangers of financial innovation in a world where creditors could be destroyed by debtors with armies.

## Overview

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Founded | 1119, Jerusalem |
| Founders | Hugues de Payens and companions |
| Purpose | Protect pilgrims to Holy Land |
| Rule | Based on Cistercian (Bernardine) |
| Peak | ~15,000-20,000 members, vast wealth |
| Suppressed | 1307-1312 |
| End | Dissolved by Pope Clement V |

## From Warriors to Bankers

### Phase 1: Military Foundation (1119-1150)

| Development | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| Origin | Nine knights protecting pilgrim roads |
| Poverty | "Poor Fellow-Soldiers of Christ" |
| Recognition | Council of Troyes (1129) |
| Bernard's support | Cistercian abbot championed them |
| Rule | Monastic discipline + military function |

### Phase 2: Growth and Donations (1150-1250)

| Development | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| Donations | Flooded in from pious donors |
| Privileges | Papal exemptions from taxes, tithes |
| Commanderies | Network across Europe |
| Holy Land | Major military force |
| Wealth | Massive accumulation |

### Phase 3: Banking Dominance (1200-1307)

| Development | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| Pilgrim finance | Original banking function |
| Royal clients | Kings deposited, borrowed |
| International transfers | Moved money across Europe |
| Reputation | "Safe as the Temple" |
| Paris Temple | Europe's financial center |

---

## The Banking Innovations

### The Problem They Solved

| Challenge | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Pilgrim travel | Dangerous to carry cash |
| Distance | Jerusalem 3,000+ km from France |
| Bandits | Robbery common |
| Currency | Different coins everywhere |
| Trust | Who could you rely on? |

### The Templar Solution

| Service | How It Worked |
|---------|---------------|
| Deposits | Store valuables securely |
| Transfers | Deposit in London, withdraw in Acre |
| Letters of credit | Paper instead of coin |
| Currency exchange | Convert between currencies |
| Loans | Advances against deposits or land |

### How Transfers Worked

```
1. Pilgrim deposits money at London Temple
2. Receives encoded letter of credit
3. Travels to Holy Land
4. Presents letter at Acre Temple
5. Receives equivalent (minus fee) in local currency
6. Internal Templar accounting settles the balance
```

**They invented the traveler's check 700 years before American Express.**

### Security Features

| Feature | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| Encoded letters | Prevent forgery |
| Network verification | Confirm authenticity |
| Reputation | Forgers faced powerful enemy |
| Templar honor | Religious vow backed transactions |

## The Financial Network

### Geographic Reach

| Region | Presence |
|--------|----------|
| France | Headquarters (Paris), dense network |
| England | Major presence, London Temple |
| Iberia | Reconquista involvement |
| Italy | Trade connections |
| Holy Land | Military headquarters |
| Germany | Significant holdings |

### The Commandery System

| Level | Function |
|-------|----------|
| Grand Master | Overall leadership |
| Provincial Masters | Regional authority |
| Commanderies | Local houses (~870 total) |
| Preceptories | Smaller units |

Each commandery was:
- Economic unit (farming, production)
- Banking branch (deposits, loans)
- Recruitment center
- Way station for travel

### The Paris Temple

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Location | Fortified complex, Paris |
| Function | European headquarters |
| Treasury | Royal treasury of France stored there |
| Security | Fortress within city |
| Reputation | Most secure vault in Europe |

**The French kings kept their treasury at the Temple—until Philip IV decided to take it.**

---

## Royal Finance

### Services to Kings

| Service | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Treasury management | Stored royal funds |
| Tax collection | Gathered revenues |
| Accounting | Managed royal finances |
| Loans | Advances against future income |
| Transfers | Moved funds across kingdoms |

### Notable Royal Clients

| King | Relationship |
|------|--------------|
| Louis VII (France) | Crusade finance |
| Henry II (England) | Treasury services |
| Richard I (England) | Crusade loans |
| Louis IX (France) | Close relationship |
| Philip IV (France) | Destroyed them |

### The Crown Jewels Example

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 1204 | King John deposits English crown jewels |
| Security | Temple vault protection |
| Symbolism | Most valuable items trusted to Templars |

---

## The Business Model

### Revenue Sources

| Source | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Donations | Ongoing pious gifts |
| Land income | Rents from vast estates |
| Banking fees | Transaction charges |
| Interest | Disguised as fees (usury prohibition) |
| Trade | Some commercial activity |

### Avoiding Usury

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Church banned interest | Officially, no "interest" charged |
| Reality | Fees, exchange rate manipulation |
| Currency exchange | Built-in profit margin |
| "Gifts" | Voluntary additions to repayment |
| Penalties | Late fees were acceptable |

**The Templars navigated the usury prohibition through financial creativity.**

### Scale of Wealth

| Measure | Estimate |
|---------|----------|
| Commanderies | ~870 across Europe |
| Annual income | Enormous (hard to quantify) |
| Land holdings | One of largest landowners |
| Liquid assets | Vast deposits |

---

## Strengths and Vulnerabilities

### Why Clients Trusted Them

| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Religious vows | Bound by sacred oath |
| Military power | Could defend assets |
| Papal protection | Above secular law |
| Network | Present everywhere needed |
| Reputation | Centuries of reliability |
| No heirs | Institution was perpetual |

### The Fatal Weakness

| Vulnerability | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| Creditor to kings | Kings resented debts |
| No army in France | Military force was in Holy Land |
| Papal dependence | If Pope turned, they were vulnerable |
| Concentrated assets | Could be seized in coordinated strike |
| Envy | Wealth attracted enemies |

**The Templars could protect against bandits but not against kings.**

---

## The Fall

### Background

| Factor | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Holy Land lost | Acre fell 1291, military purpose gone |
| Philip IV's debts | Owed Templars enormously |
| French treasury | Philip had raided it before |
| Precedent | Philip had expelled Jews, seized assets (1306) |

### The Strike (October 13, 1307)

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Date | Friday, October 13, 1307 |
| Action | Coordinated arrests across France |
| Surprise | Sealed orders opened simultaneously |
| Charges | Heresy, blasphemy, sodomy |
| Torture | Confessions extracted |

### The Charges

| Accusation | Reality |
|------------|---------|
| Denying Christ | Almost certainly false |
| Spitting on cross | Fabricated |
| Idol worship | No evidence |
| Sodomy | Standard accusation against enemies |
| Secret rituals | Exaggerated normal practices |

**The charges were pretexts—Philip wanted their money.**

### The Legal Process

| Stage | Date |
|-------|------|
| Arrests | October 1307 |
| Papal suspension | November 1307 |
| Council of Vienne | 1311-1312 |
| Dissolution | March 1312 |
| Last Grand Master burned | March 1314 |

### Jacques de Molay

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Position | Last Grand Master |
| Arrested | 1307 |
| Confessed | Under torture |
| Recanted | Withdrew confession |
| Executed | Burned at stake, March 1314 |
| Legend | Cursed Philip and Pope from flames |

---

## What Happened to the Wealth

### Official Disposition

| Assets | Destination |
|--------|-------------|
| Land and property | Transferred to Hospitallers |
| Debts owed to Templars | Often uncollected |
| Liquid assets | Largely disappeared |

### Reality

| Beneficiary | Gain |
|-------------|------|
| Philip IV | Immediate cash, debt cancellation |
| French crown | Seized French properties |
| Hospitallers | Some land (burdened by transfer costs) |
| Various kings | Local seizures |

**The Hospitallers nominally inherited but Philip extracted "expenses" that consumed much of the value.**

## Legacy

### For Banking

| Development | Templar Contribution |
|-------------|---------------------|
| Letters of credit | Pioneered system |
| International transfers | Demonstrated feasibility |
| Trust networks | Model for later banks |
| Branch banking | Commandery system |

### For State-Finance Relations

| Lesson | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Creditor vulnerability | Those who lend to kings risk destruction |
| Sovereign default | Kings can simply take |
| Legal pretexts | Charges can be manufactured |
| Coordination | Debtors with power can eliminate creditors |

### Later Parallels

| Event | Parallel |
|-------|----------|
| Bardi-Peruzzi crash (1343) | Edward III default—but no violence |
| Fugger decline | Habsburgs couldn't repay—gradual |
| Modern sovereign defaults | Legal, not physical destruction |

**The Templars learned that being owed by kings was dangerous. Later bankers learned to diversify their sovereign exposure.**

### The Friday the 13th Legend

| Claim | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Arrests on Friday 13th | True |
| Origin of superstition | Unlikely but popular belief |
| Cultural impact | Persistent legend |
