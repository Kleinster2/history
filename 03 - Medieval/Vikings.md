# Vikings

The Vikings (793-1066 CE) transformed early medieval Europe through raiding, trading, and settlement. From their Scandinavian homelands, these seafaring Norse warriors reached Baghdad via Russian rivers, colonized Iceland and Greenland, and briefly touched North America. But Vikings were traders as much as raiders—their networks moved silver, slaves, furs, and amber across continents. The Viking Age shows how violence and commerce intertwined in medieval economic development.
