# Comparative Medieval Institutions

Why did [[Venice]] and [[Florence]] produce capitalism's institutional foundations while Baghdad, Delhi, and Hangzhou—equally wealthy, equally sophisticated—did not sustain commercial development? The answer lies in who controlled the cities. European communes were self-governing merchant republics where those who created wealth made the rules. Elsewhere, merchants remained subordinate to political authorities who could expropriate at will. This institutional difference—merchant political power versus merchant political subordination—compounded over centuries to produce the [[Great Divergence]].

## Overview

| Region | City type | Merchant status | Outcome |
|--------|-----------|-----------------|---------|
| Northern Italy | Commune | Ruling class | Capitalism |
| Hanseatic | City league | Powerful | Commerce |
| Islamic | Under caliphate/sultanate | Subordinate | Stagnation |
| Chinese | Imperial | Subordinate | No accumulation |
| Indian | Royal courts | Subordinate | Extraction |

## European Communes

| Feature | Character |
|---------|-----------|
| Self-government | Merchants ruled themselves |
| Charters | Formal rights from lords |
| Law | Merchant-made, merchant-enforced |

| Institution | Function |
|-------------|----------|
| Great Council | Merchant oligarchy |
| Doge | Elected executive |
| Colleganza | Standardized contracts |
| Arsenal | State enterprise |
| Rialto | Commercial center |
| Property rights | Secured by ruling class |

## Islamic Cities

### Political Structure

| Feature | Character |
|---------|-----------|
| Authority | Caliph, sultan, emir |

| [[Islamic Golden Age\|Golden Age]] prosperity | Declined after Mongols |

### Why No Communes?

| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Caliphal authority | Cities were administrative |
| Military slaves | Rulers had own force |
| Tax farming | Extraction, not investment |
| Ulama | Alternative elite |

## Chinese Cities

### [[Song Dynasty]] Paradox

| Commercial revolution | Didn't produce capitalism |
| Technological innovation | Didn't sustain |
| Urban economy | Officials controlled |
| Paper money | State controlled |

### Why No Merchant Power?

| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Examination system | Merit → bureaucracy |
| Confucian ideology | Commerce demeaned |
| State capacity | Could control cities |
| No military autonomy | Merchants defenseless |

| Guilds | Less autonomous |

### Merchant Position

| Factor | Reality |
|--------|---------|

| Property | Subject to extraction |

### Why No Merchant Rule?

| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Caste system | Occupational divisions fixed |
| Royal authority | Cities were royal |
| Temple economy | Religious not commercial |
| Fragmentation | No unified merchant class |

## The Key Difference

### European Exception

| Feature | Significance |
|---------|--------------|
| Weak emperors | No effective central control |
| Multiple polities | Competition for merchants |
| Church | Separate from state |
| City charters | Formal rights |
| Military autonomy | Communes could defend |

### Why It Mattered

| Consequence | Effect |
|-------------|--------|
| Property rights | Secured by those who held property |
| Law | Made by those it affected |
| Investment | Protected, so incentivized |
| Accumulation | Could build over generations |
| Innovation | Rewarded |

### Counterfactual

| Without merchant power | Result |
|------------------------|--------|
| Venice | Would be like Constantinople |
| Florence | Would be like Cairo |
| Hanseatic | Would be like Chinese ports |

## Long-Term Consequences

### Europe

| Development | Chain |
|-------------|-------|
| Communes | Merchant power |
| Merchant power | Secure property |
| Secure property | Investment |
| Investment | Accumulation |
| Accumulation | Capitalism |

### Elsewhere

| Development | Chain |
|-------------|-------|
| State control | Merchant subordination |
| Subordination | Insecure property |
| Insecurity | Consumption over investment |
| No accumulation | No capitalism |
| Stagnation | Relative decline |

## The Deeper Point

The [[Great Divergence]] had medieval roots: European merchants gained political power; elsewhere, they didn't. This wasn't about culture or religion—Islamic and Chinese merchants were commercially sophisticated, technically innovative, and enormously wealthy. The difference was institutional: who made the rules? In [[Venice]], merchant families controlled the Great Council. In [[Florence]], guilds governed the city. In the Hanseatic League, cities set their own policies. But in Baghdad, merchants depended on caliphs who could confiscate at will. In Hangzhou, merchants were subject to scholar-officials who disdained commerce. In Delhi, traders prospered only at royal pleasure. The European commune was an institutional mutation—merchants who ruled themselves—that produced a self-reinforcing cycle: political power → secure property → investment → accumulation → more power. Elsewhere, the cycle ran the other way: political subordination → insecure property → consumption → stagnation. The same [[Institutions and Progress|entrepreneurial ambition]] that Baumol identified was channeled differently: into productive commerce in Venice, into seeking official favor in China, into military service in the Islamic world. The rules of the game determined the direction of the players.
