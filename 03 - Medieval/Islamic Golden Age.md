# Islamic Golden Age

The Islamic Golden Age (750-1258 CE) was a period of extraordinary cultural, scientific, and economic achievement under the Abbasid Caliphate. While Europe entered its "Dark Ages," Islamic civilization preserved Greek learning, advanced mathematics and medicine, and built the medieval world's most sophisticated commercial economy. Baghdad became the world's largest city and the hub of transcontinental trade.
