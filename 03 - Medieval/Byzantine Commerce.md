# Byzantine Commerce

The Eastern Roman continuation. For a thousand years after Rome's western half fell, the Byzantine Empire maintained sophisticated commerce, stable currency, and state-managed trade. Constantinople was the world's largest city and greatest market. Understanding Byzantine commerce illuminates both the possibilities and limits of state-directed economic systems.

| Territorial losses | Tax base shrank |
| Fourth Crusade | Never recovered fully |
| Ottoman rise | Final pressure |

### What Survived

| Element | Continuation |
|---------|--------------|
| Trade routes | Through Constantinople |
| Techniques | Transmitted |
| Model | Russian adoption |
| Legacy | Orthodox world |

## The Deeper Point

Byzantine commerce demonstrates both the possibilities and limits of state-managed economies. For centuries, the empire maintained stable currency, regulated trade, and managed production through guilds. Constantinople thrived as the world's greatest market.

But the Byzantine model also shows the costs of state control. The regulated guilds limited innovation. The silk monopoly protected technology but restricted enterprise. When competition from Italian merchants emerged, Byzantine commerce couldn't adapt.

The 1082 Chrysobull is particularly instructive. Facing military crisis, Byzantium traded commercial advantage for Venetian naval support. The short-term military benefit created long-term economic dependency. By exempting Venetians from taxes, the state impoverished both its treasury and its merchants, who couldn't compete with tax-free foreigners.

The [[Institutions and Progress|institutional]] lesson is that stability and dynamism may trade off. Byzantine commercial institutions provided stability—reliable currency, predictable regulations, quality control. But they also created rigidity. When the Italian city-states emerged with more flexible, innovative commercial practices, the Byzantine system couldn't match them.

The Fourth Crusade's economic dimension reveals how commercial interests could redirect even "holy" enterprises. Venice used the crusade framework to eliminate a commercial rival and seize its trade routes. Religion provided the mobilization; commerce provided the direction.
