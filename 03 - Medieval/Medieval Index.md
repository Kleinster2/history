# Medieval History (500 - 1500 CE)

The Medieval period saw not one but several economic florescence—the Islamic Golden Age, Song China's commercial revolution, and Europe's gradual recovery. This era challenges the old narrative of a "Dark Ages" gap between Rome and modernity, revealing instead parallel developments across Afro-Eurasia connected by long-distance trade.

## Timeline Overview

| Early Medieval | 500-1000 | Post-Roman fragmentation, Islamic expansion |
| High Medieval | 1000-1300 | Commercial revolution, Crusades, Mongol Empire |
| Late Medieval | 1300-1500 | Black Death, Ming China, European exploration |
