# Medieval Peasant Economy

The economic life of the majority. Most medieval Europeans were peasants who farmed under various systems of obligation—free, servile, or somewhere between. Understanding their economic constraints explains why medieval growth was slow and why the Black Death transformed labor relations.

## Who Were Peasants?

### Categories

| Status | Rights |
|--------|--------|
| Free peasants | Own land, pay rent, can leave |
| Villeins (serfs) | Bound to manor, labor services |
| Cottagers | Minimal land, work for others |
| Slaves | Property (rare by High Middle Ages) |

### Distribution

| Region | Character |
|--------|-----------|
| England | Mixed, villeinage common |
| France | Varied by region |
| Germany | More servile in east |
| Italy | More free, urban influence |

## The Open Field System

### Structure

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Three fields | Rotating cultivation |
| Strip holdings | Peasant plots scattered |
| Common pasture | Shared grazing |
| Waste/woodland | Collective access |

### The Three-Field Rotation

| Field | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|
| A | Winter grain | Spring grain | Fallow |
| B | Spring grain | Fallow | Winter grain |
| C | Fallow | Winter grain | Spring grain |

### Why Scattered Strips?

| Reason | Logic |
|--------|-------|
| Risk spreading | Bad soil in one area |
| Fair distribution | Mix good and bad land |
| Collective plowing | Heavy plow needed teams |
| Tradition | Inheritance division |

## Peasant Obligations

### Labor Services (Servile)

| Service | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Week-work | Regular labor on demesne |
| Boon-work | Harvest time, extra days |
| Carrying | Transport services |
| Carting | Manor needs |

### Rents and Dues

| Payment | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| Cash rent | Land payment |
| Kind payment | Share of harvest |
| Entry fine | Inheritance fee |
| Merchet | Marriage payment |
| Heriot | Death duty (best beast) |

### Church Dues

| Payment | Rate |
|---------|------|
| Tithe | 10% of produce |
| Church fees | Baptism, marriage, burial |
| Mortuary | Death payment |

## The Subsistence Margin

### Typical Holdings

| Size | Status |
|------|--------|
| Virgate (~30 acres) | Substantial peasant |
| Half-virgate | Moderate |
| Cottar holding (~5 acres) | Insufficient alone |

### The Budget

| Requirement | Priority |
|-------------|----------|
| Seed corn | Next year's crop |
| Rent/obligations | Must be paid |
| Family subsistence | Basic survival |
| Surplus (if any) | Market sale |

### Vulnerability

| Risk | Consequence |
|------|-------------|
| Bad harvest | Hunger, debt |
| Two bad years | Starvation possible |
| Lord's demands | Can increase |
| Disease | Lost labor |

## Market Participation

### What Peasants Sold

| Product | When |
|---------|------|
| Grain surplus | Good years |
| Livestock | When needed cash |
| Wool | Sheep regions |
| Dairy | Near towns |
| Labor | When land insufficient |

### What Peasants Bought

| Good | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Salt | Preservation |
| Iron tools | Essential |
| Cloth | Sometimes |
| Ale/beer | Local markets |

### Market Penetration

| Observation | Implication |
|-------------|-------------|
| Varied by region | Near towns, more market |
| Increased over time | Commercialization grew |
| Still limited | Subsistence primary |

## Peasant Household

### Family Labor

| Member | Role |
|--------|------|
| Male head | Field work, heavy labor |
| Wife | Dairy, poultry, garden, spinning |
| Children | Help as able |
| Servants | Hired if wealthy |

### Domestic Production

| Activity | Output |
|----------|--------|
| Brewing | Ale for household |
| Baking | Bread (or paid at lord's mill) |
| Spinning | Thread for cloth |
| Gardening | Vegetables, herbs |

## Constraints on Innovation

### Why Change Was Slow

| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Collective farming | Individual innovation hard |
| Scattered strips | Consolidation difficult |
| Subsistence pressure | Risk aversion |
| Lord's control | Limited autonomy |
| Tradition | "How it's always done" |

### What Could Change

| Innovation | When Possible |
|------------|---------------|
| New crops | Gradual adoption |
| Better tools | Slow diffusion |
| More clearing | With permission |
| Intensification | Post-plague |

## The Black Death Impact

### Before (1300-1348)

| Condition | Character |
|-----------|-----------|
| Population | Peak, land pressure |
| Wages | Low (labor abundant) |
| Rents | High (land scarce) |
| Peasant power | Limited |

### After (1350-1500)

| Change | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Population halved | Labor scarce |
| Wages rose | Bargaining power |
| Rents fell | Land abundant |
| Servile dues | Commuted to cash |
| Mobility | Increased despite law |

### The Peasant Revolt (1381)

| Cause | Poll tax, labor laws |
| Demand | End villeinage |
| Outcome | Immediate failure |
| Long-term | Servile labor declined |

## Regional Variation

### England

| Period | Character |
|--------|-----------|
| Pre-plague | Strong manorialism |
| Post-plague | Labor services declined |
| 15th century | Free tenants dominate |

### Eastern Europe

| Period | Character |
|--------|-----------|
| Same period | [[Second Serfdom]] |
| Direction | Opposite—intensification |
| Why | Different political economy |

## The Deeper Point

Medieval peasant economy shows why [[Institutions and Progress|institutional constraints]] limited growth. Most people lived at or near subsistence, producing primarily for household consumption with limited surplus for market. The obligations they owed—to lords, to church, to community—claimed much of any surplus.

Innovation was difficult not because peasants were stupid but because the institutional environment discouraged risk-taking. Collective farming meant individual experiments were hard. Subsistence margins meant failure was catastrophic. Lord's claims meant surplus went elsewhere.

The Black Death's impact reveals that these institutions weren't permanent. When labor became scarce, peasants gained bargaining power. They could demand wage increases, negotiate lower rents, or simply leave for better opportunities. The servile obligations that seemed fixed for centuries eroded within generations.

The contrast with Eastern Europe's [[Second Serfdom]] is instructive. In the West, peasant power increased post-plague; in the East, lords intensified control. Same demographic shock, different institutional outcomes—depending on prior political arrangements. Institutions aren't determined by economics alone; they're negotiated in political contexts that vary by place.
