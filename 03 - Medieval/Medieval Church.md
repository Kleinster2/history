# Medieval Church

The medieval Catholic Church was Europe's dominant institution—a spiritual authority, political power, and economic force without parallel. Owning perhaps 25-33% of all land, the Church was the largest landlord, employer, and banker. Monasteries preserved learning, developed agriculture, and produced goods. The Church's economic role—tithes, donations, land management—made it inseparable from medieval economic life. Understanding medieval economy requires understanding the Church.
