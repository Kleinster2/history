# Manorialism

Manorialism—the economic system organizing medieval agricultural production—centered on the manor: an estate combining lord's demesne land with peasant holdings. Peasants owed labor services and dues in exchange for land use and protection. This system dominated European agriculture for centuries, slowly evolving toward money rents and peasant emancipation. Manorialism reveals how medieval economies organized production without markets.
