# Italian Banking

From money changers to Medici. Between the 12th and 15th centuries, Italian merchant-bankers invented the basic techniques of modern finance—bills of exchange, double-entry bookkeeping, branch banking, letters of credit. They became bankers to popes and kings, and their innovations spread across Europe.

## Origins

### From Money Changing to Banking

| Stage | Development |
|-------|-------------|
| Cambio | Currency exchange at fairs |
| Deposit-taking | Merchants leave funds |
| Transfer | Move money between accounts |
| Lending | Use deposits to lend |
| Bills | Credit instruments |

### Why Italy?

| Factor | Advantage |
|--------|-----------|
| Trade position | Mediterranean commerce |
| Papal connection | Church banking needs |
| Urban development | Commercial cities |
| Fragmentation | Competition, innovation |

## Key Innovations

### Bill of Exchange

| Feature | Function |
|---------|----------|
| Written order | Pay at future date, distant place |
| Negotiable | Can be transferred |
| Currency conversion | Implicit in transaction |
| Usury avoidance | Not explicitly "interest" |

### Example Bill Transaction

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| Florence merchant | Needs funds in Bruges |

### Double-Entry Bookkeeping

| Feature | Benefit |
|---------|---------|
| Every transaction | Two entries (debit, credit) |
| Balance requirement | Books must balance |

| Profit tracking | Clear accounting |

Formalized by Luca Pacioli (1494), but practiced earlier.

### Branch Networks

| Innovation | Benefit |
|------------|---------|
| Partners in cities | Local presence |

## The Deeper Point

Italian banking shows how [[Institutions and Progress|institutional innovation]] responds to functional needs—and how those innovations spread. Medieval commerce needed credit, but Church doctrine banned interest. Italian bankers found workarounds that performed the same economic function without violating the letter of religious law.

The solutions they developed—bills of exchange, branch networks, partnership structures, double-entry accounting—became universal techniques. The bill of exchange was particularly elegant: it looked like currency exchange (permitted) while functioning as credit (forbidden). This creative tension between religious restriction and commercial need drove innovation.

The Medici partnership structure anticipated modern corporate organization. By creating separate legal entities for each branch, with the parent holding partnerships in each, they limited risk and aligned incentives. A branch's failure wouldn't bring down the whole enterprise—unlike the Bardi and Peruzzi, who were destroyed by English default.

Italian banking also reveals the political economy of finance. Bankers to popes and kings gained political influence; the Medici ruled Florence. But lending to sovereigns was dangerous—kings could default without consequence. The Bardi-Peruzzi collapse showed that even the largest banks could fail when sovereign borrowers refused to pay.

The techniques outlasted Italian dominance. When Atlantic trade shifted commerce north, the methods Italian bankers developed went with it. Lombard Street in London, named for Italian bankers, became the world's financial center—using techniques invented in Florence and Venice.
