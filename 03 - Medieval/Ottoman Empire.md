# Ottoman Empire

The Ottoman Empire (c. 1299-1922) was one of history's longest-lived empires—spanning six centuries from a small Anatolian principality to a vast realm controlling Southeast Europe, the Middle East, and North Africa. The Ottomans conquered Constantinople (1453), controlled crucial trade routes, and created distinctive administrative and economic systems. The empire's economic history illuminates how Islamic commercial traditions, European trade, and imperial taxation interacted.
