# Mali Empire

The Mali Empire was the wealthiest state in the medieval world at its peak. Controlling the gold fields of West Africa and the trans-Saharan trade routes, Mali's rulers accumulated legendary fortunes. When Mansa Musa made his pilgrimage to Mecca in 1324, he distributed so much gold that he destabilized Mediterranean currency markets. Mali demonstrated that Africa was central, not peripheral, to medieval global trade.
