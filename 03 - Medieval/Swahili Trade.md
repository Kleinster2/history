# Swahili Trade

The Swahili coast was Africa's gateway to the Indian Ocean world. From Mogadishu to Sofala, a string of city-states traded African gold, ivory, and slaves for Asian textiles, ceramics, and manufactures. The Swahili—speaking a Bantu language enriched with Arabic—created a distinctive commercial civilization that integrated Africa into the global economy centuries before European arrival.
