# Cairo

Cairo was the greatest city of the medieval Islamic world after Baghdad's decline—a commercial hub connecting the Mediterranean to the Indian Ocean, a center of learning and culture, and seat of successive powerful dynasties. For centuries, Cairo dominated East-West trade, and its wealth funded monuments that still define Egypt. The city's history spans Fatimid splendor, Mamluk power, and Ottoman incorporation.
