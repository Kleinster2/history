# Medieval Credit Networks

Medieval merchants created credit systems that enabled trade without moving cash across dangerous routes. Bills of exchange transferred value across borders; merchant banks provided credit to traders and rulers; hawala and suftaja enabled Islamic commerce; [[Jewish Diaspora Economy|Jewish networks]] connected Christian and Muslim worlds. These instruments—predecessors of modern banking—created trust infrastructure enabling long-distance trade without central authority.

## The Deeper Point

Medieval credit networks solved the fundamental problem of [[Trade Networks|long-distance trade]]: how to transact without moving vulnerable cash across dangerous routes. The bill of exchange let a merchant in Florence pay a supplier in Bruges without either party handling coins on the road. Hawala let traders across the Islamic world transfer value through trusted agents. Jewish networks connected systems that couldn't connect directly. These instruments created [[Institutions and Progress|trust infrastructure]]—mechanisms for strangers to transact reliably. They depended not on central authority but on reputation, repeated interaction, and community enforcement. The Medici Bank's correspondent network worked because default meant exclusion from future credit. Hawala agents honored transfers because their business depended on trust. Jewish lenders could operate across borders because their community enforced obligations. These private-order institutions enabled commerce that states couldn't directly provide—a pattern that would continue through the [[Dutch Golden Age Model|Dutch Golden Age]] to modern finance. Credit was the lubricant of medieval commerce; without it, trade would have been constrained to what could be carried in coins.
