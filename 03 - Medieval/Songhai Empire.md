# Songhai Empire

The Songhai Empire succeeded Mali as West Africa's dominant power, controlling an even larger territory at its peak. Under Sunni Ali and the Askia dynasty, Songhai commanded the trans-Saharan trade, the Niger River commerce, and the legendary cities of Timbuktu and Djenné. Its abrupt destruction by Moroccan invasion in 1591 marked the end of the great Sahelian empires.
