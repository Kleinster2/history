# Byzantine Empire

The Byzantine Empire was Rome's continuation in the East—surviving the western collapse by a thousand years. Constantinople was medieval Europe's greatest city, controlling trade between East and West, preserving classical knowledge, and maintaining sophisticated economic institutions. The Byzantines showed that Roman civilization could adapt and endure, even as they created something distinctly new.
