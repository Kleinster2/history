# Buddhism

Buddhism—the religion founded by Siddhartha Gautama (the Buddha) in 5th century BCE India—spread across Asia to become one of the world's major religions. But Buddhism was also an economic phenomenon: monasteries became landowners, bankers, and trade facilitators; the Silk Road carried Buddhist monks alongside merchants; temple economies shaped Asian societies. Understanding Buddhism means understanding how religious institutions participated in economic life.
