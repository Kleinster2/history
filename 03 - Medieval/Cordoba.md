# Córdoba

Córdoba was the jewel of Islamic Spain—at its peak the largest, most cultured city in Western Europe. Under the Umayyad caliphate, Córdoba rivaled Baghdad and Constantinople: a center of learning where Muslims, Christians, and Jews created a distinctive civilization. Its economy combined agriculture, crafts, and trade across the Mediterranean. When it fell to Christian reconquest in 1236, medieval Europe's most sophisticated urban center passed into history.
