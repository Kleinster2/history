# Abbasid Caliphate

The Abbasid Caliphate (750-1258 CE)—the third Islamic caliphate—presided over Islam's golden age. With Baghdad as their magnificent capital, the Abbasids created a cosmopolitan empire where commerce flourished, science advanced, and diverse peoples mingled. The caliphate's economic achievements included sophisticated banking, extensive trade networks, and agricultural innovation. The Mongol destruction of Baghdad in 1258 marked the end of an era.
