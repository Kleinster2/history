# Tang Dynasty

The Tang Dynasty (618-907 CE) was China's golden age—an era of territorial expansion, cultural flourishing, and commercial prosperity. Tang China dominated the Silk Road, welcomed foreign merchants and religions, and developed sophisticated financial instruments. Its capital Chang'an was the world's largest city, a cosmopolitan hub where Central Asian, Persian, and Chinese cultures mixed. The Tang represents medieval Asia's economic and cultural peak.
