# Crusades

The Crusades were a series of religious wars launched by Western Christians to recapture the Holy Land from Muslim rule. From 1095 to 1291, waves of crusaders fought for Jerusalem, establishing and then losing a string of states in the Levant. Beyond religious motivation, the Crusades opened trade routes, transferred technology, and transformed both European and Middle Eastern societies.
