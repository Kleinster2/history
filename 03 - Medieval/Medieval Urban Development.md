# Medieval Urban Development

Cities were the engines of medieval economic development, but not all cities were equal. European communes governed themselves, creating institutions that channeled ambition into commerce. Islamic qasbahs operated under caliphal authority with merchant subordination. Chinese imperial cities served administrative rather than commercial purposes. The institutional form of cities determined whether they produced capitalism or merely concentrated population. Venice and Florence generated modern capitalism; Baghdad and Hangzhou, despite greater wealth, did not.

## The Deeper Point

Cities concentrated people, but [[Institutions and Progress|institutions]] determined outcomes. Medieval [[Venice]] and [[Song Dynasty|Song Hangzhou]] were comparably large, wealthy, and commercially sophisticated. But Venice produced modern capitalism—joint-stock companies, securities markets, international banking—while Hangzhou did not. The difference was governance: Venice was a merchant republic where those who created wealth made the rules. Hangzhou was an imperial city where scholar-officials controlled merchants. Venice could enforce contracts, protect property, and innovate institutionally because merchants controlled the state. Hangzhou merchants, however wealthy, remained subordinate to bureaucrats who could expropriate or regulate at will. The same pattern appears everywhere: European communes that self-governed produced capitalism; Islamic and Chinese cities under external authority produced commerce but not accumulation. Urban development was not just about density or wealth—it was about who ruled the city. Where merchants ruled, they created institutions that protected and extended their interests. Where rulers ruled, merchants remained tools of the state. The [[Great Divergence]] thus had medieval urban roots.
