# Feudalism

Feudalism describes the medieval European system of land-for-service—where lords granted land (fiefs) to vassals in exchange for military and other obligations. This created a hierarchical society of lords, vassals, and peasants (serfs) bound to the land. Whether feudalism was a coherent "system" or just a modern label for diverse medieval practices remains debated, but the term captures essential features of medieval European political economy.
