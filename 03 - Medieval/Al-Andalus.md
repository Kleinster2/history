# Al-Andalus

Al-Andalus—Islamic Iberia from 711 to 1492—was a distinctive civilization where Muslim, Christian, and Jewish communities coexisted with varying degrees of tolerance. Córdoba under the Umayyads rivaled Baghdad and Constantinople in splendor. Al-Andalus transmitted classical knowledge to medieval Europe, developed sophisticated agriculture, and created distinctive art and architecture. Its economic achievements included advanced irrigation and thriving urban commerce.
