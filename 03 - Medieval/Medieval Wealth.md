# Medieval Wealth

Medieval wealth looked different from ancient or modern—land was paramount, but couldn't simply be bought and sold. The Church accumulated vast holdings. Then merchants and bankers created new fortunes that rivaled kings, pioneering financial instruments that transformed what wealth could be. The tension between landed aristocracy and commercial wealth shaped the era.

## The Land Basis

### Why Land Dominated

| Factor | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Production | Agriculture was ~90% of economy |
| Power | Land = military obligation = political power |
| Status | Nobility defined by landholding |
| Security | Land couldn't be stolen like gold |
| Inheritance | Passed through generations |

### Land vs. Money

| Land Wealth | Money Wealth |
|-------------|--------------|
| Stable | Volatile |
| Prestigious | Suspect (usury fears) |
| Political power | Less direct power |
| Illiquid | Liquid |
| Inherited | Often self-made |

### The Feudal Constraint

| Feature | Effect on Wealth |
|---------|------------------|
| Land tenure | Held from lord, not owned outright |
| Military obligation | Wealth meant service duties |
| Primogeniture | Eldest son inherited, kept estates intact |
| Entail | Couldn't sell inherited land |
| Church restrictions | Couldn't bequeath to Church easily (mortmain) |

**You could be "wealthy" in land but unable to convert it to cash.**

## Inequality

| Gini coefficient | 0.4-0.6 (varied by region/period) |
| Top 10% share | 40-60% of wealth |

- Wealthy families in 1427 still wealthier in 2011
- 600 years of persistence
- Suggests deep structural advantages
