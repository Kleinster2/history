# Wool Trade

England's medieval export economy. For three centuries, English wool was Europe's finest, feeding Flemish looms and generating royal revenue through export taxes. The wool trade shaped English economic policy, financed wars, and established commercial practices that persisted into the modern era.

## Why English Wool?

### Quality Advantage

| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Sheep breeds | Fine, long-staple wool |
| Climate | Cool, damp, good pasture |
| Monasteries | Improved breeding (Cistercians) |
| Reputation | Premium prices |

### Scale

| Period | Export Volume |
|--------|---------------|
| c. 1280 | ~30,000 sacks/year |
| c. 1350 | ~25,000 sacks/year |
| c. 1400 | ~15,000 sacks (declining) |

One sack = 364 pounds of raw wool

## The Trade System

### English Side

| Actor | Role |
|-------|------|
| Monasteries | Large-scale producers |
| Landlords | Estate wool production |
| Merchants | Wool collection, export |
| Crown | Taxation, regulation |

### Flemish Side

| Actor | Role |
|-------|------|
| Cloth cities | Bruges, Ghent, Ypres |
| Weavers | Transform wool to cloth |
| Merchants | Finished cloth trade |
| International | Cloth to all Europe |

### The Flow

| Stage | Location |
|-------|----------|
| Production | English countryside |
| Collection | Wool merchants |
| Export | To Staple town |
| Processing | Flemish cities |
| Sale | International markets |

## The Staple System

### What It Was

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Staple | Designated export point |
| Monopoly | All wool must pass through |
| Location | Varied (Bruges, Calais, etc.) |
| Final | Calais (1363-1558) |

### How It Worked

| Step | Function |
|------|----------|
| Wool brought | To Staple town |
| Customs paid | Export duties |
| Quality checked | Standards enforced |
| Sold | To foreign buyers |
| Duty | Government revenue |

### The Company of the Staple

| Feature | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| Merchant guild | Control wool export |
| Royal charter | Monopoly grant |
| Calais | Operated staple there |
| Functions | Collection, quality, credit |

## Crown Revenue

### Wool and War Finance

| Connection | Mechanism |
|------------|-----------|
| Export duty | Custom on each sack |
| Maltolt | Additional levies |
| Loans | Against future customs |
| Scale | Major revenue source |

### The Numbers

| Period | Wool Customs Share |
|--------|-------------------|
| Edward I | ~£100,000/year at times |
| Edward III | War finance tool |
| Later | Declining as exports fell |

### Political Consequences

| Effect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Parliament | Negotiated taxes for rights |
| Merchants | Political influence |
| Policy | Wool policy shaped by revenue |
| Hundred Years War | Wool financed it |

## The Textile Shift

### From Raw to Cloth

| Period | Export Pattern |
|--------|----------------|
| Pre-1350 | Raw wool dominant |
| 1350-1450 | Transition |
| Post-1450 | Cloth exports dominant |

### Why the Shift?

| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| English cloth production | Grew, quality improved |
| Flemish decline | Wars, labor conflicts |
| Crown policy | Encouraged domestic processing |
| Value added | More profit in cloth |

### Effects

| Change | Consequence |
|--------|-------------|
| English industry | Textile manufacturing grew |
| Flemish cities | Declined |
| Trade balance | Improved for England |
| Employment | Domestic jobs |

## Institutional Features

### Quality Control

| Mechanism | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| Staple inspection | Standards maintained |
| Merchant reputation | Quality assurance |
| Grades | Price differentiation |
| Marks | Identify source |

### Credit Practices

| Practice | Function |
|----------|----------|
| Advance purchases | Wool bought before clip |
| Loans to producers | Secured on future wool |
| Bills | Payment instruments |
| Clearing | At fairs, staple |

### The Wool-Credit System

| Step | Process |
|------|---------|
| Italian merchants | Advance money |
| To English monasteries | Against future wool |
| Wool delivered | At agreed price |
| Credit function | De facto lending |

## Social Implications

### Enclosure Pressures

| Connection | Mechanism |
|------------|-----------|
| Wool demand | Sheep farming profitable |
| Sheep vs. grain | Less labor needed |
| Enclosure incentive | Convert arable to pasture |
| "Sheep eat men" | Later Tudor complaint |

### Regional Effects

| Region | Development |
|--------|-------------|
| Cotswolds | Wool prosperity |
| Yorkshire | Cloth production later |
| East Anglia | Cloth industry grew |
| Monasteries | Wealth from wool |

## The Deeper Point

The wool trade shows how [[Institutions and Progress|comparative advantage]] worked in medieval commerce—and how institutions shaped its development. England's natural advantage (good wool) was channeled through institutional arrangements (the Staple) that served multiple purposes: quality control, tax collection, and political leverage.

The Staple system reveals the political economy of medieval trade. The Crown needed revenue; merchants needed monopoly; Parliament needed bargaining chips. The resulting institution served all three, but in ways that also constrained economic development. Forcing all wool through Calais was inefficient but controllable.

The shift from raw wool to cloth exports demonstrates how institutional arrangements respond to changing incentives. As English cloth production improved and Flemish dominance declined, the comparative advantage shifted. The same institutions that had managed wool exports adapted to cloth—but the process took generations.

The wool-credit relationship with Italian merchants also shows how [[Medieval Financial Innovation|financial innovation]] emerged from trade needs. Advancing money against future wool clips was lending in practice, whatever religious law said about usury. Commercial needs drove financial evolution.

The later enclosure pressures reveal unintended consequences. Wool's profitability encouraged converting grain land to pasture, displacing agricultural labor. The same trade that brought prosperity also created social dislocation—a pattern that would repeat in later industrial transitions.
