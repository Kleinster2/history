# Medieval Society

Medieval European society—roughly 500-1500 CE—was characterized by hierarchy, localism, and the intertwining of religious and secular authority. The three estates (clergy, nobility, commoners) provided ideological framework; [[Feudalism]] organized political and military relationships; manorialism structured economic life. Yet medieval society was more dynamic than its static ideology suggested, with commerce reviving, cities growing, and social mobility occurring.
