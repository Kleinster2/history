# Universities

Medieval institutions that shaped knowledge production. Emerging in the 12th century as guilds of scholars, European universities created frameworks for transmitting knowledge, credentialing expertise, and building intellectual networks that persisted for centuries—the human capital infrastructure of medieval Europe.

## Origins

### The First Universities

| University | Founded | Specialty |
|------------|---------|-----------|
| Bologna | ~1088 | Law |
| Paris | ~1150 | Theology |
| Oxford | ~1167 | General |
| Cambridge | 1209 | General |
| Padua | 1222 | Medicine, law |
| Naples | 1224 | State-founded |

### Why Universities Emerged

| Factor | Contribution |
|--------|--------------|
| Cathedral schools | Prior education base |
| Urbanization | Concentrated students |
| Church needs | Trained clergy, lawyers |
| Rediscovered texts | Aristotle, Roman law |
| Corporate organization | Guild model available |

## Structure

## Intellectual Production

### What Universities Produced

| Output | Character |

|-----------------|---------------------|
| Degrees | BA, MA, PhD |
| Faculties | Departments |
| Academic freedom | Tenure concept |
| Governance | Faculty self-rule |

## The Deeper Point

Universities institutionalized [[Human Capital|knowledge transmission]]—creating the organizational infrastructure for education that persisted across centuries. The medieval university was a corporation: a self-governing body with legal rights, internal rules, and defined membership. This corporate structure gave universities resilience; they survived changes of regime, economic crises, and social upheaval.

The [[Institutions and Progress|institutional]] innovation was making education systematizable and portable. The degree system created universal credentials; the "right to teach anywhere" meant knowledge could flow across political boundaries. A Paris master could teach in Oxford; a Bologna lawyer could practice in Padua. The university created a European intellectual labor market.

But the same institutions that transmitted knowledge also constrained it. The curriculum centered on authoritative texts—Aristotle, Justinian, the Bible—interpreted through commentary and disputation. This method produced sophisticated analysis but not empirical discovery. When the Scientific Revolution came, it happened largely outside universities; the institutions of medieval learning had become obstacles to new methods.

The university's persistence shows how successful institutions can outlast the conditions that created them. The medieval university emerged to train clergy and administrators; it survived to become the primary institution for knowledge production in the modern world. But its conservatism—built into the original design—had to be overcome for that adaptation to work.
