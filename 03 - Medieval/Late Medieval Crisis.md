# Late Medieval Crisis

The 14th century brought catastrophe: the [[Black Death]] killed 30-60% of Europe's population, famines recurred, wars devastated regions. But crisis exposed institutional variation. In Western Europe, labor scarcity raised wages, serfdom declined, and survivors prospered. In Eastern Europe, lords reimposed serfdom, creating a "second serfdom" that would last centuries. The same demographic shock produced opposite outcomes—proof that institutions, not just events, determine trajectories.

## Overview

| Crisis | Dates | Impact |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Great Famine | 1315-1322 | 10-15% mortality |
| [[Black Death]] | 1348-1353 | 30-60% mortality |
| Recurring plagues | 1360s-1400s | Continued losses |
| Hundred Years War | 1337-1453 | Economic disruption |
| Population nadir | ~1400 | Lowest point |

## The Great Famine (1315-1322)

### Causes

| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Climate | Extreme rainfall |
| Harvest failure | Multiple years |
| Previous expansion | Marginal lands under cultivation |
| Population | Near Malthusian limit |

### Effects

| Impact | Scale |
|--------|-------|
| Mortality | 10-15% of population |
| Livestock | Massive die-offs |
| Prices | Extreme volatility |
| Social order | Breakdown in some areas |

## The Black Death (1348-1353)

### Mortality

| Region | Death rate |
|--------|------------|
| Overall Europe | 30-60% |
| Cities | Often higher |
| Some villages | Near total |
| Variation | Enormous by place |

### Immediate Effects

| Effect | Character |
|--------|-----------|
| Labor shortage | Drastic |
| Wages | Rose sharply |
| Rents | Fell (fewer tenants) |
| Prices | Volatile, then fell |
| Abandoned lands | Marginal areas |

## Western European Response

### Labor Market Changes

| Development | Effect |
|-------------|--------|
| Wage demands | Workers could bargain |
| Statute of Laborers (1351) | Attempt to cap wages |
| Failure | Couldn't enforce caps |
| Migration | Workers moved to better offers |
| Serfdom | Declined |

### Peasant Resistance

| Event | Date | Outcome |
|-------|------|---------|
| French Jacquerie | 1358 | Suppressed |
| English Peasants' Revolt | 1381 | Suppressed but serfdom faded |
| Catalonia | 1460s-1480s | Eventually successful |

### Long-Term Effects

| Change | Mechanism |
|--------|-----------|
| Higher wages | Persisted for generations |
| Serfdom decline | Market not manorial labor |
| Diet improvement | More meat, better nutrition |
| Land consolidation | Larger, more efficient farms |
| Urban growth | Resumed after initial crisis |

## Eastern European Divergence

### The "Second Serfdom"

| Region | Development |
|--------|-------------|
| Prussia | Lords imposed serfdom |
| Poland | Peasants bound to land |
| Russia | Serfdom intensified |
| Hungary | Similar pattern |

### Why Different?

| Factor | West | East |
|--------|------|------|
| Towns | Strong, offered refuge | Weak, couldn't absorb |
| Lords | Competing, divided | Dominated legislatures |
| Markets | Developed | Grain export |
| State | Protected peasants | Supported lords |
| Labor | Scarce everywhere | Lords could coerce |

### Consequences

| West | East |
|------|------|
| Free labor | Bound labor |
| Market economy | Manorial economy |
| Urban growth | Rural stagnation |
| Innovation incentive | Coercion incentive |
| Eventual industrialization | Delayed development |

## Economic Restructuring

### Agriculture

| Change | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Marginal land abandoned | More efficient cultivation |
| Pastoral increase | Sheep, cattle more profitable |
| Enclosure begins | Land consolidation |
| Productivity | Output per worker rose |

### Urban Economy

| Change | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Initial contraction | Population loss |
| Recovery | Faster than rural |
| Wages | Higher, attracted labor |
| Industry | Restructured |
| Trade | Continued |

### Innovation Pressure

| Constraint | Response |
|------------|----------|
| Labor scarcity | Labor-saving devices |
| Wage pressure | Mechanization incentive |
| Need for efficiency | Innovation reward |
| Examples | Mills, printing, navigation |

## Institutional Resilience

### What Survived

| Institution | Adaptation |
|-------------|------------|
| [[Guild Economics Deepened\|Guilds]] | Restricted entry further |
| [[Medieval Financial Innovation\|Banking]] | Continued, some failures |
| [[Trade Networks]] | Recovered, restructured |
| [[Medieval Urban Development\|Cities]] | Variable recovery |
| [[Manorialism]] | Transformed |

### What Changed

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| Labor surplus | Labor scarcity |
| Serfdom dominant | Wage labor rising |
| Lords' market | Workers' market |
| Expansion | Consolidation |
| Population pressure | Space, opportunity |

## Regional Patterns

### Fast Recovery

| Region | Factors |
|--------|---------|
| Northern Italy | Commercial sophistication |
| Low Countries | Trade networks |
| Southern England | London markets |
| Rhineland | Urban network |

### Slow Recovery

| Region | Factors |
|--------|---------|
| Eastern Europe | Second serfdom |
| Iberia | Reconquista disruption |
| France | Hundred Years War |
| Some German areas | Political fragmentation |

## The Deeper Point

The late medieval crisis reveals that [[Institutions and Progress|institutions]], not just events, determine outcomes. The [[Black Death]] was the same demographic shock everywhere—30-60% population loss across Europe. But outcomes diverged dramatically: in England and the Low Countries, serfdom faded, wages rose, and the foundation for eventual industrialization was laid. In Prussia and Poland, lords reimposed serfdom, binding peasants to the land for centuries. The difference wasn't the plague—it was the institutional context. Where towns were strong, peasants could flee to cities. Where lords were divided, they couldn't coordinate coercion. Where states protected peasants (as England's crown sometimes did against lords), market relations developed. Where lords controlled legislatures, they legally bound peasants. The same crisis produced opposite outcomes because pre-existing institutions channeled response differently. This "second serfdom" would shape European divergence for half a millennium—contributing to why the [[Industrial Revolution]] happened in Britain, not Brandenburg. Crisis is the test of institutions: those that adapt survive; those that rigidify ossify.
