# Song Dynasty

The Song Dynasty (960-1279 CE) presided over China's commercial revolution—an economic transformation that some scholars consider the beginning of modern economic growth. Song China pioneered paper money, developed extensive markets, and saw unprecedented urbanization. Its technological innovations—printing, gunpowder, compass—would later transform the world. Though militarily weaker than Tang, Song's economic sophistication was unmatched in the medieval world.
