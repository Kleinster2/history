# Jewish Diaspora Economy

The Jewish diaspora developed distinctive economic roles across medieval Europe and the Islamic world—not by choice, but by exclusion. Barred from landowning, guilds, and many trades, Jews were pushed into commerce, money-lending, and finance. This marginal position became economically significant: diaspora networks enabled long-distance trade, and Jewish financiers filled gaps that Christian usury prohibitions created. The diaspora economy demonstrates how exclusion can create specialized economic niches.

| Joseph Süß Oppenheimer | Württemberg finance        |
| Rothschilds            | Banking dynasty (later)    |

### The Rothschild Model

The Rothschilds (from 1798) represent the culmination of Jewish financial networks—and the bridge from court finance to modern international banking:

| Innovation | Significance |
|------------|--------------|
| Five sons, five cities | London, Paris, Frankfurt, Vienna, Naples |
| Information speed | Private couriers faster than governments |
| Cross-border coordination | Family trust substitutes for institutions |
| Sovereign lending | Funded wars, railroads, canals across Europe |
| Scale | Largest bank in the world by 1820s |

The Rothschild system worked because family trust solved the problem that no international legal framework yet existed for cross-border finance. Their network was both a product of Jewish exclusion (no other career channels) and a demonstration of [[Institutions and Progress|how constraints channel talent into commerce]]. See [[Foundational Firms]].
