# Medieval Europe Economy

Medieval European economy evolved from post-Roman fragmentation through gradual recovery to commercial florescence. The narrative of "Dark Ages" stagnation is misleading—by 1300, Europe had developed sophisticated commerce, banking, and manufacturing that would form the foundation for later global expansion. But compared to Song China or the Islamic world, Europe was catching up, not leading.
