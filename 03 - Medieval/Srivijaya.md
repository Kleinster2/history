# Srivijaya

Srivijaya was the first great maritime empire of Southeast Asia, controlling the strategic Strait of Malacca for over six centuries. From its capital near modern Palembang, it dominated the sea lanes connecting China and India, extracting tribute from passing ships and redistributing goods across a vast trading network. Srivijaya demonstrated that maritime power—controlling choke points and trade routes—could build empire without territorial conquest.
