# Mongol Economy

The Mongol Empire created the largest contiguous land empire in history—and paradoxically, history's greatest free trade zone. The Pax Mongolica connected China to Europe under a single political authority, enabling unprecedented movement of goods, people, ideas, and diseases across Eurasia. The Mongols were destroyers and connectors simultaneously.
