# Medieval Economy

The medieval European economy evolved from the fragmented, agrarian world of the early Middle Ages to the commercial revival of the high medieval period. Beginning with manorial self-sufficiency and limited trade, medieval Europe developed fairs, banking, long-distance commerce, and urban manufacturing. The period laid foundations for modern capitalism while operating under constraints of feudal obligation, guild regulation, and religious prohibition on usury.

### The Deeper Point

The medieval economy is the vault's great puzzle: how did Europe go from post-Roman fragmentation to the cusp of industrialization? The answer isn't any single innovation but *institutional competition*. Europe's political fragmentation—hundreds of competing jurisdictions—created a market for institutions: merchants could leave oppressive cities for welcoming ones, forcing rulers to offer better terms ([[Property Rights|property protection]], [[Guild Economics|guild charters]], legal predictability). This is [[Institutions and Progress|the vault's thesis]] in its purest form: not that medieval Europeans were smarter or richer, but that their *political disunity* accidentally created the competitive institutional environment that channeled ambition into commerce rather than conquest. China was richer, the Islamic world more learned, but both were unified enough that rulers could extract without competing for mobile capital.
