# Black Death

The Black Death (1346-1353) was history's deadliest pandemic—killing 30-60% of Europe's population and transforming medieval society. The plague traveled along trade routes from Central Asia, devastating cities and villages alike. The massive death toll created labor shortages that broke serfdom, raised wages, and shifted economic power from landlords to peasants. The Black Death marks a turning point in European economic history.
