# Confucianism

Confucianism—the philosophical tradition founded by Confucius (551-479 BCE)—shaped Chinese civilization for two millennia, providing the ideological foundation for governance, social hierarchy, and education. Though not a religion in the Western sense, Confucianism organized political and economic life through its emphasis on hierarchy, education, and moral cultivation. The examination system that selected officials was fundamentally Confucian.
