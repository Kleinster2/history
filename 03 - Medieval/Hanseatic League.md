# Hanseatic League

The Hanseatic League was medieval Europe's most successful trade confederation—a network of German merchant towns that dominated Baltic and North Sea commerce for four centuries. Unlike the luxury trade of Venice, the Hansa dealt in bulk goods: grain, fish, timber, furs. Their model of collective action among independent cities created a trading power without a state.
