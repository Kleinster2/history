# Champagne Fairs

The medieval trading hub. From the 12th to early 14th century, six annual fairs in the Champagne region of France served as Europe's commercial crossroads—where Northern cloth met Southern goods, where debts were cleared across nations, and where financial techniques evolved that would shape European commerce.

## The System

### The Six Fairs

| Fair | Location | Month |
|------|----------|-------|
| Lagny | Lagny-sur-Marne | January-February |
| Bar-sur-Aube | Bar-sur-Aube | March |
| May | Provins | May |
| St. John | Troyes | June-July |
| St. Ayoul | Provins | September |
| St. Rémi | Troyes | October-November |

### Continuous Cycle

| Feature | Benefit |
|---------|---------|
| Year-round coverage | Always one fair active |
| Predictable schedule | Planning possible |
| Traveling merchants | Could attend multiple |
| Continuous business | No off-season |

## The Deeper Point

The Champagne Fairs show how [[Institutions and Progress|institutions]] for reducing transaction costs enable trade expansion. The fairs solved multiple problems simultaneously: bringing buyers and sellers together (reducing search costs), providing courts for dispute resolution (reducing enforcement costs), enabling credit clearing (reducing financing costs), and guaranteeing security (reducing risk).

The fairs' financial innovations were particularly significant. The settling phase created what was essentially a medieval clearing house—a way to net debts across multiple parties, reducing the need to move coin. The fair letters evolved into bills of exchange, which became the foundation of European commercial finance.

The fairs' decline is equally instructive. When Italian ships began sailing directly to Flanders, the geographic advantage disappeared. When the French crown absorbed Champagne and raised taxes, the institutional advantages eroded. The functions the fairs performed continued—they just moved to other institutions and places.

What survived were the techniques: bills of exchange, clearing mechanisms, commercial law, and the model of neutral meeting grounds with predictable rules. The Champagne Fairs were a crucial step in developing the financial infrastructure that later enabled larger-scale commerce.
