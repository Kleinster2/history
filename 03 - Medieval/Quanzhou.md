# Quanzhou

Quanzhou was the greatest port in the medieval world—the eastern terminus of maritime trade routes connecting China to Southeast Asia, India, the Middle East, and beyond. During the Song and Yuan dynasties, it was perhaps the world's largest port, home to merchants from across Asia and the Middle East. Marco Polo called it one of the two greatest ports in the world. Its cosmopolitan community of Arab, Persian, Indian, and Southeast Asian traders made it a true global city.
