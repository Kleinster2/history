# Khazaria

The Khazar Khaganate was a Turkic steppe empire that controlled the crucial territory between the Black and Caspian seas from the 7th to 10th centuries. Uniquely among medieval states, its ruling elite converted to Judaism. Economically, Khazaria sat astride major trade routes connecting Scandinavia to the Islamic world—the northern branch of the [[Radhanites|Radhanite]] network and the Volga trade route that carried Abbasid silver to Viking lands.
