# Venetian Trade

Venice was medieval Europe's greatest trading power—a city of canals that dominated Mediterranean commerce for five centuries. From the Crusades to the Ottoman challenge, Venetian merchants connected Europe with Asia, trading spices, silk, and slaves. Venice pioneered commercial institutions: banking, insurance, accounting, state-merchant cooperation. The Republic's trading empire demonstrates how commercial wealth could create lasting political power.

### The Deeper Point

Venice demonstrates what happens when a state *is* a business. The Republic's constitution was designed by and for merchants: the Doge was a CEO constrained by shareholders (the Great Council), commercial law was the primary law, and foreign policy served trade routes. This alignment of political power with productive enterprise—rather than with landed aristocracy or military conquest—is why Venice innovated continuously in commercial techniques (insurance, banking, contract law, the Arsenal's proto-factory). But Venice also shows the limits: when the Great Council closed membership in 1297 (the *Serrata*), it gradually shifted from [[Institutions and Progress|inclusive to extractive institutions]]. The same elite that had built the system began protecting its position rather than enabling competition. Venice's arc from commercial republic to oligarchic stagnation is the vault's institutional thesis as biography.
