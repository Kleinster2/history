# Venetian Trade

Venice was medieval Europe's greatest trading power—a city of canals that dominated Mediterranean commerce for five centuries. From the Crusades to the Ottoman challenge, Venetian merchants connected Europe with Asia, trading spices, silk, and slaves. Venice pioneered commercial institutions: banking, insurance, accounting, state-merchant cooperation. The Republic's trading empire demonstrates how commercial wealth could create lasting political power.
