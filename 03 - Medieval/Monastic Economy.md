# Monastic Economy

Monasteries were medieval Europe's most successful economic institutions—accumulating vast lands, pioneering agricultural techniques, and in some cases becoming international bankers. The paradox: organizations founded on poverty vows became engines of wealth accumulation. Understanding monastic economy reveals how religion, labor, and capital interacted in the medieval world.

## The Monastic Proposition

### Why Monasteries Accumulated Wealth

| Factor | Mechanism |
|--------|-----------|
| Perpetual institution | Never died, never divided inheritance |
| Pious donations | Gifts for salvation |
| Low consumption | Austere living, surplus reinvested |
| Disciplined labor | Organized, reliable workforce |
| Literacy | Record-keeping, contracts, management |
| Tax advantages | Often exempt from tithes, dues |

### The Compound Effect

```
Donation received
      ↓
Low consumption (vows)
      ↓
Surplus reinvested
      ↓
More land, more production
      ↓
More donations (success attracts gifts)
      ↓
Repeat for centuries
```

**Monasteries were the first institutions to benefit from compound growth over generations.**

## Cistercian Revolution

| Withdrawal | Became economic powers |
| Manual labor | Eventually hired workers |

**By 1200, Cistercians were criticized for the same wealth they'd originally rejected.**
