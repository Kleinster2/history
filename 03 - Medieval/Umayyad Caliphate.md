# Umayyad Caliphate

The Umayyad Caliphate (661-750 CE)—the second Islamic caliphate—oversaw Islam's greatest territorial expansion, stretching from Spain to Central Asia. Based in Damascus, the Umayyads created an Arab empire with sophisticated administration adapted from Byzantine and Persian models. Their economic achievements included coinage reform, agricultural development, and trade expansion, though tensions over Arab privilege contributed to their overthrow.
