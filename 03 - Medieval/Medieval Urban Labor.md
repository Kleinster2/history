# Medieval Urban Labor

Medieval cities offered something revolutionary: escape from manorial constraints. Through apprenticeship, urban migration, and wage labor, ambitious peasants could transform themselves into skilled craftsmen, merchants, even citizens. The institutional framework of urban labor—guilds, courts, contracts—created pathways for advancement that didn't exist in the countryside. After the [[Black Death]], labor scarcity transformed urban labor markets, raising wages and increasing worker power.

## The Deeper Point

Medieval cities created the first large-scale labor markets where individual talent could be rewarded regardless of birth. The institutional infrastructure—[[Guild Economics Deepened|guilds]], courts, citizenship laws, apprenticeship contracts—channeled [[Institutions and Progress|ambition]] into productive paths. An ambitious peasant son could migrate to a city, complete an apprenticeship, become a journeyman, accumulate capital, and eventually become a master craftsman with his own shop and possibly citizenship. This pathway didn't exist in the countryside, where manorial bonds determined life prospects. The [[Black Death]] accelerated the transformation by creating labor scarcity that strengthened worker bargaining power despite attempts at wage controls. The Western European pattern—where plague strengthened labor—contrasted with Eastern Europe's "second serfdom," revealing how the same demographic shock could produce opposite institutional outcomes depending on the prior balance of power. Urban labor institutions channeled ambition into commerce and craft rather than military service or land accumulation—the [[Business Firm|productive entrepreneurship]] that Baumol identified as the foundation of progress.
