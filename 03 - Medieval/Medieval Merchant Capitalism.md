# Medieval Merchant Capitalism

Before the corporation, medieval merchants developed sophisticated partnership forms to pool capital and share risk. The commenda, societas, and family firm represented institutional experiments in collective enterprise—solving the problems of trust, liability, and duration that would later drive corporate innovation. These partnerships built Venice, Florence, and the Hanseatic cities, creating the institutional foundations for modern capitalism.

## The Deeper Point

Medieval partnerships solved capitalism's fundamental coordination problem: how to pool capital among people who don't trust each other. The commenda separated capital from management, enabling wealthy investors to fund active traders. The societas enabled multiple investors to share both risk and profit. Family firms used kinship to create trust without formal contracts. These innovations enabled the commercial revolution—[[Venice]] and [[Florence]] built empires on partnership contracts. But partnerships had limits: unlimited liability discouraged large investments, short duration prevented accumulation, and death dissolved the firm. The corporation (first in [[Dutch Golden Age Model|Amsterdam]], then [[English Commercial Empire|London]]) solved these problems by creating an entity that outlived its founders, limited liability to encourage investment, and made shares transferable to enable exit. Medieval partnerships were thus capitalism's training wheels—essential for learning to organize collective enterprise, but ultimately replaced by more powerful institutional forms.
