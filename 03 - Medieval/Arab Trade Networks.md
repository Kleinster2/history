# Arab Trade Networks

The commercial world before European expansion. For centuries before Portuguese ships reached the Indian Ocean, Arab merchants dominated maritime trade from East Africa to China. Their networks—built on dhow sailing, Islamic commercial law, and trust-based relationships—created the first global trade system.

## The Deeper Point

Arab trade networks demonstrate how [[Institutions and Progress|institutions]]—not technology or state power—enabled pre-modern globalization. Arab dhows weren't technologically superior; Arab states weren't militarily dominant. What made the system work was institutional infrastructure: Islamic commercial law providing consistent rules, trust networks enabling long-distance credit, diaspora communities providing local knowledge.

The [[Trade Networks|network structure]] was key. No central authority organized Arab trade; no company held monopoly. Instead, thousands of independent merchants, linked by religion, reputation, and repeated dealing, created emergent order. The system was resilient precisely because it was decentralized: no single failure could collapse it.

Islamic commercial law deserves emphasis. The mudaraba partnership solved the agency problem that plagues long-distance trade: how to trust someone with your capital in a distant port. The legal framework—recognizing different contribution types, specifying profit sharing, allocating risk—made cooperation between strangers possible. This was institutional innovation enabling economic activity.

The European disruption reveals different institutional logics. Portuguese strategy was state-backed violence: capture chokepoints, demand tribute, monopolize by force. This was extraction through power rather than profit through service. Initially effective, it proved costly to maintain and ultimately unsustainable. The Arab system, though disrupted, partially survived precisely because it depended on relationships rather than fortifications.

The spread of Islam along trade routes shows how commerce transmits culture. Merchants carried not just goods but ideas, practices, religion. Southeast Asian Islam arrived through trade, not conquest. The connection between commerce and cultural diffusion—markets as channels for more than material goods—recurs throughout economic history.
