# Khmer Empire

The Khmer Empire, centered at Angkor, was one of the largest and most sophisticated states of the medieval world. At its peak, Angkor may have been the world's largest city—a million people supported by an extraordinary hydraulic system that turned the Cambodian plain into the most productive rice-growing region on Earth. The empire's economy combined intensive agriculture, regional trade, and temple-centered redistribution.
