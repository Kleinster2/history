# Mongol Empire

The Mongol Empire was history's largest contiguous land empire—stretching from Korea to Poland at its peak. Founded by Genghis Khan in 1206, the Mongols conquered through unmatched mobility and ruthless efficiency. But beyond destruction came the Pax Mongolica: a unified Eurasian trade zone where silk, spices, ideas, and unfortunately plague traveled more freely than ever before.
