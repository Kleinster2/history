# Carolingian Empire

The Carolingian Empire was the largest Western European state since Rome—a Frankish realm that under Charlemagne (768-814) stretched from the Pyrenees to the Elbe and from the North Sea to Rome. Economically, it marked a low point in European commerce but also laid foundations for recovery: monastery networks preserved agricultural knowledge, coinage reforms standardized money, and the manorial system organized rural production. The empire's fragmentation after 843 created the map of medieval Europe.
