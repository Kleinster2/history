# Rise of Civilization

The rise of civilization—the emergence of cities, states, writing, and social complexity—followed the [[Agricultural Revolution]] in several world regions. Beginning around 4000 BCE in [[Mesopotamia]] and Egypt, civilizations developed independently in the Indus Valley, China, Mesoamerica, and the Andes. Understanding why some agricultural societies became civilizations while others did not illuminates fundamental questions about human social evolution.
