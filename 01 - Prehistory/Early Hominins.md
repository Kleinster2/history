# Early Hominins

The earliest members of the human lineage emerged during the late Miocene epoch, approximately 7-6 million years ago. These early hominins document the transition from ape-like ancestors to the first creatures that walked upright, setting the foundation for all subsequent human evolution.

## Overview

### What is a Hominin?
**Hominins** (tribe Hominini) are the group consisting of modern humans, extinct human species, and all our ancestors after the split from the last common ancestor with chimpanzees.

**Key Defining Features:**
- Obligate or habitual bipedalism
- Reduced canine teeth (especially in later species)
- Reorganized pelvis for upright walking
- Members of the human evolutionary lineage

### The Human-Ape Split

| Estimate Source | Divergence Time |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| Molecular clocks (average) | 7-6 Ma |
| Fossil evidence | 7-6 Ma (consistent) |
| Range of estimates | 10-5 Ma |

The split occurred during a period of:
- Global cooling and drying
- Forest fragmentation in Africa
- C4 grassland expansion
- Environmental instability

## The Earliest Hominins

### Sahelanthropus tchadensis (7-6 Ma)

**Discovery:**
- Found: 2001-2002
- Location: Toros-Menalla, Chad (Djurab Desert)
- Discovered by: Michel Brunet's team
- Key specimen: TM 266-01-060-1 ("Toumaï" = "hope of life")

**Anatomy:**

| Feature | Condition | Significance |
|---------|-----------|--------------|
| Cranial capacity | ~360 cc | Chimpanzee-sized brain |
| Face | Flat, orthognathic | Unlike apes, more human-like |
| Brow ridge | Massive, continuous | Larger than later hominins |
| Canines | Small, worn from tip | Hominin-like, not honed |
| Foramen magnum | Anteriorly positioned | Suggests upright posture |
| Nuchal plane | Horizontal | Consistent with bipedalism |

**Evidence for Bipedalism:**
- Foramen magnum (spinal cord opening) positioned under skull
- This placement is associated with balancing the head on a vertical spine
- However, no postcranial bones definitively confirmed

**Controversy:**
- Some argue it's an ape, not a hominin
- Femur discovered in 2001 described in 2022 - debated interpretation
- Geographic location (Chad) unexpected - far from East African Rift

**Significance:**
If bipedal, *Sahelanthropus* is the oldest known hominin and demonstrates that:
- Human origins may have occurred across a broad African region
- The human-ape split occurred before 6-7 Ma
- Early hominins retained many primitive features

### Orrorin tugenensis (6.1-5.7 Ma)

**Discovery:**
- Found: 2000
- Location: Tugen Hills, Kenya
- Discovered by: Brigitte Senut and Martin Pickford
- Nickname: "Millennium Man"

**Specimens:**
- 20 fossils from at least 5 individuals
- Femora (thigh bones), jaw fragments, teeth, finger bones

**Anatomy:**

| Element | Features | Interpretation |
|---------|----------|----------------|
| Femur | Long neck, groove for obturator externus | Bipedal adaptations |
| Femoral head | Large, spherical | Weight-bearing bipedalism |
| Teeth | Small canines, thick enamel | Hominin-like diet |
| Finger bones | Curved | Retained climbing ability |

**Evidence for Bipedalism:**
The femur shows clear adaptations for bipedal locomotion:
- **Obturator externus groove**: Muscle insertion consistent with bipedal hip mechanics
- **Femoral neck**: Elongated as in later hominins
- **Cortical bone distribution**: Thickened to resist bipedal stresses

**Paleoenvironment:**
- Woodland and forest habitats
- Gallery forests along watercourses
- Some open areas nearby
- Suggests bipedalism evolved in wooded environments

**Significance:**
*Orrorin* provides the earliest definitive postcranial evidence for bipedalism and suggests that upright walking preceded major brain expansion.

### Ardipithecus kadabba (5.8-5.2 Ma)

**Discovery:**
- Found: 1997-2002
- Location: Middle Awash, Ethiopia
- Described by: Yohannes Haile-Selassie

**Specimens:**
- Teeth, jaw fragments, hand bones, foot bones, clavicle
- From multiple sites and individuals

**Anatomy:**
| Feature | Condition |
|---------|-----------|
| Canines | Large but hominin-like wear |
| Toe bone (AME-VP-1/71) | Suggests bipedal push-off |
| Arm bones | Suggests retained climbing ability |

**Environment:** Wooded, closed-canopy forests

**Significance:**
Bridges the gap between *Sahelanthropus/Orrorin* and the later, better-known *Ardipithecus ramidus*. The toe bone morphology suggests bipedal push-off during walking.

### Ardipithecus ramidus (4.5-4.3 Ma)

**Discovery:**
- Found: 1992-1994 (described fully in 2009)
- Location: Aramis, Middle Awash, Ethiopia
- Discovered by: Tim White, Gen Suwa, Berhane Asfaw

**Key Specimen:** "Ardi" (ARA-VP-6/500) - 45% complete skeleton

**Anatomy:**

| Feature | Condition | Significance |
|---------|-----------|--------------|
| Cranial capacity | ~300-350 cc | Small, ape-sized |
| Canines | Reduced, no honing | Hominin trait |
| Pelvis | Short, broad ilium | Bipedal adaptation |
| Foot | Opposable big toe | Retained grasping ability |
| Arm/leg ratio | Arms relatively long | Retained climbing ability |
| Hands | Flexible wrist, long palm | Not knuckle-walker |

**Locomotion - A Mosaic:**
*Ardi* was neither fully bipedal nor a typical ape:
- **Bipedal on ground**: Pelvis shows clear adaptations for upright walking
- **Arboreal climber**: Opposable big toe, curved fingers
- **NOT a knuckle-walker**: Challenges view that humans evolved from knuckle-walkers

**Key Insights:**
1. Bipedalism evolved in a forest context, not on the savanna
2. The last common ancestor with chimps was NOT a knuckle-walker
3. Knuckle-walking in gorillas and chimps evolved independently
4. Canine reduction occurred early, possibly related to social behavior

**Paleoenvironment:**
- Woodland with trees, palms, and fig trees
- Closed-canopy forest near Aramis
- Colobus monkeys, forest birds in fauna
- Contradicts savanna hypothesis for bipedalism origins

**Significance:**
*Ardipithecus ramidus* is the most complete early hominin and fundamentally changed our understanding of human origins. It shows that:
- Bipedalism preceded open-habitat adaptation
- Early hominins retained significant arboreal abilities
- The chimpanzee/gorilla body plan is derived, not primitive

## Summary of Early Hominin Species

| Species | Age (Ma) | Location | Key Evidence |
|---------|----------|----------|--------------|
| *Sahelanthropus tchadensis* | 7-6 | Chad | Cranium, possible femur |
| *Orrorin tugenensis* | 6.1-5.7 | Kenya | Femora, teeth |
| *Ardipithecus kadabba* | 5.8-5.2 | Ethiopia | Teeth, toe bone |
| *Ardipithecus ramidus* | 4.5-4.3 | Ethiopia | Partial skeleton |

## The Evolution of Bipedalism

### Why Did Bipedalism Evolve?

Multiple hypotheses have been proposed:

| Hypothesis | Mechanism | Evidence |
|------------|-----------|----------|
| **Postural feeding** | Reaching for food in trees | *Ardipithecus* arboreal context |
| **Thermoregulation** | Reducing sun exposure | Would apply in open habitats |
| **Freeing hands** | Carrying food/infants/tools | Universal among hominins |
| **Energy efficiency** | Bipedal walking is efficient | True for long-distance travel |
| **Vigilance** | Seeing over grass/detecting predators | Requires open habitat |
| **Display** | Social/sexual signaling | Reduced canines correlate |

**Current Understanding:**
Bipedalism likely evolved for multiple reasons in woodland environments. *Ardipithecus* suggests that feeding posture and arboreal origins were important, contradicting the classic savanna hypothesis.

### Anatomical Changes for Bipedalism

| Structure | Ape Condition | Hominin Adaptation |
|-----------|---------------|-------------------|
| Foramen magnum | Posterior | Anterior/inferior |
| Spine | Straight or single curve | S-shaped lumbar lordosis |
| Pelvis | Tall, narrow | Short, broad, bowl-shaped |
| Femur | Angled outward | Valgus angle (angled inward) |
| Knee | Simple hinge | Locking mechanism |
| Foot | Grasping, opposable hallux | Platform, in-line big toe |

## Social Behavior and Canine Reduction

A striking feature of early hominins is reduced canine size, especially in males.

### Canine Function in Apes
- Male-male competition displays
- Intrasexual combat
- Sexual dimorphism in size

### Implications of Reduction
Reduced canines in early hominins suggest:
- Decreased male-male aggression
- Possible pair-bonding or cooperative breeding
- Shift away from canine-based dominance
- Owen Lovejoy's model: provisioning and pair bonds

## Paleoenvironments of Early Hominins

| Species | Habitat | Evidence |
|---------|---------|----------|
| *Sahelanthropus* | Lake shores, gallery forest | Associated fauna, isotopes |
| *Orrorin* | Woodland, forest edges | Fauna, paleosols |
| *Ar. kadabba* | Closed forest | Fauna, isotopes |
| *Ar. ramidus* | Woodland with trees | Detailed floral/faunal analysis |

**Key Conclusion:** Early hominins evolved in forested or wooded habitats, not open savannas. Savanna adaptation came later.

## The Transition to Australopiths

By ~4.2 Ma, early hominins gave rise to the australopiths:

### Australopithecus anamensis (4.2-3.9 Ma)
- Oldest *Australopithecus* species
- Kenya and Ethiopia
- More derived bipedal adaptations than *Ardipithecus*
- Possible ancestor of *A. afarensis*

**Key Changes from *Ardipithecus*:**
| Feature | *Ardipithecus* | *Australopithecus* |
|---------|---------------|-------------------|
| Big toe | Opposable | Aligned with other toes |
| Bipedalism | Facultative | Obligate |
| Enamel | Thin | Thick |
| Habitat | Woodland | More varied |

## Geographic Distribution

Early hominins are found across a broad African region:

| Region | Species Found |
|--------|---------------|
| Chad | *Sahelanthropus* |
| Kenya | *Orrorin* |
| Ethiopia | *Ardipithecus* |

This suggests that early hominins were not confined to the East African Rift Valley but were distributed across tropical Africa where suitable woodland habitats existed.

## Key Questions and Debates

### 1. Which Species is Ancestral to Later Hominins?
- All three early hominin genera are potential ancestors
- *Ardipithecus* best known but may not be directly ancestral
- Multiple lineages may have coexisted

### 2. Was Bipedalism Arboreal in Origin?
- *Ardipithecus* strongly supports this
- Upright posture may have begun in trees
- Ground bipedalism followed

### 3. Did Bipedalism Evolve Once or Multiple Times?
- *Oreopithecus* (Miocene ape) shows convergent bipedalism
- Among hominins, likely evolved once
- But details of locomotion varied among species

### 4. What Drove Canine Reduction?
- Social behavior changes (pair bonding?)
- Dietary shifts (using hands/tools instead of teeth?)
- Sexual selection changes
