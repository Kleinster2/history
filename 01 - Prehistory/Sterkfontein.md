# Sterkfontein Caves

Sterkfontein is the richest hominin fossil site in the world, having produced over 700 hominin specimens including "Mrs. Ples" and the nearly complete "Little Foot" skeleton. Part of South Africa's "Cradle of Humankind," this limestone cave system has been fundamental to understanding human evolution.

- Multiple hominin species using tools
- Technological development

## Paleoenvironment

### Reconstructed Environment

| Period | Environment |
|--------|-------------|
| 4-3 Ma | Wetter, more wooded |
| 3-2 Ma | Variable, mosaic |
| 2-1.5 Ma | More open, drier |

### Fauna

| Group | Examples |
|-------|----------|
| Carnivores | Sabertooths, leopards, hyenas |
| Herbivores | Antelope, pigs, bovids |
| Primates | Baboons, australopiths |
| Evidence | Suggests hominins were prey |

## Taphonomy

### How Fossils Accumulated

| Process | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Carnivore accumulation | Predators brought prey |
| Natural death | Animals fell into caves |
| Water transport | Washed in |
| Multiple processes | Complex accumulation |

### Evidence for Predation

| Evidence | Interpretation |
|----------|----------------|
| Leopard damage | Tooth marks on bones |
| Death assemblages | Prey accumulations |
| Comparison | Similar to modern sites |
