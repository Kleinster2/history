# Pliocene Epoch

The Pliocene epoch (5.33-2.58 Ma) bridges the Miocene and Pleistocene, witnessing the diversification of australopiths and the emergence of the genus *Homo*. Global cooling continued, ice sheets expanded, and African environments fluctuated between woodland and grassland - conditions that shaped human evolution.

## Overview

The name "Pliocene" comes from Greek *pleion* (more) and *kainos* (new), referring to the increasing proportion of modern species. This epoch saw dramatic evolutionary and environmental changes that directly produced our ancestors.

### Key Statistics

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Duration | ~2.75 million years |
| Start | 5.33 Ma (end of Messinian) |
| End | 2.58 Ma (onset of Quaternary glaciation) |
| Period | Neogene |
| Era | Cenozoic |

### Subdivisions

| Age | Time Range (Ma) | Key Characteristics |
|-----|-----------------|---------------------|
| Zanclean | 5.33-3.60 | Mediterranean reflooding, early australopiths |
| Piacenzian | 3.60-2.58 | Mid-Pliocene warmth, australopith diversification |

## Climate

### Global Patterns

The Pliocene experienced the last relatively warm period before the Pleistocene ice ages:

| Parameter | Early Pliocene | Late Pliocene | Modern |
|-----------|----------------|---------------|--------|
| Global temp | +2-3°C | +1-2°C | Baseline |
| CO2 | 350-400 ppm | 280-350 ppm | 280 ppm (pre-industrial) |
| Sea level | +10-25 m | +5-15 m | Baseline |
| Arctic ice | Seasonal | Expanding | Permanent |

### Mid-Pliocene Warm Period (3.3-3.0 Ma)

The Mid-Pliocene Warm Period (MPWP) is studied as an analog for future climate:
- Global temperatures 2-3°C above pre-industrial
- CO2 ~400 ppm (similar to today)
- Reduced ice sheets
- Higher sea levels

### Onset of Northern Hemisphere Glaciation (~2.7 Ma)

Major ice sheets began forming in the Northern Hemisphere:
- Greenland ice sheet established
- North American glaciation begins
- Triggered by closure of Central American Seaway
- Marks transition to Pleistocene ice age world

## Tectonic Events

### Closure of the Central American Seaway

The formation of the Isthmus of Panama (~3.5-2.8 Ma) was transformative:

**Effects:**
- Separated Atlantic and Pacific oceans
- Redirected ocean currents (Gulf Stream strengthened)
- Triggered Northern Hemisphere glaciation
- Enabled Great American Biotic Interchange

### East African Rift Development

The rift system continued evolving:
- Rift valleys deepened
- Volcanic activity increased
- Lake systems formed
- Created mosaic habitats critical for hominin evolution

### Himalayan Uplift

Continued rise affected Asian monsoons and global climate patterns.

## African Environments

### Vegetation Changes

| Region | Early Pliocene | Late Pliocene |
|--------|----------------|---------------|
| East Africa | Mixed woodland-grassland | More open, variable |
| South Africa | Subtropical woodland | More seasonal |
| North Africa | Mediterranean/savanna | Increasing aridity |

### Key Features
- Expansion of C4 grasslands continued
- Forest refugia persisted in some areas
- High environmental variability
- Rift Valley created diverse microhabitats

## Fauna

### Mammals

**Hominins:**
- *Australopithecus* diversification
- *Paranthropus* emergence
- Early *Homo* by end of epoch

**Carnivores:**
- Modern cat genera established
- Hyenas diverse
- Early *Canis* (dogs)
- *Dinofelis* (false sabertooth)

**Herbivores:**
- Modern bovid tribes diversified
- Hippos and pigs common
- Elephants (*Loxodonta*, *Elephas*)
- Equids spread from Americas

### Great American Biotic Interchange

After Panama closed (~3 Ma):
- North American fauna moved south (cats, dogs, horses, camels)
- South American fauna moved north (armadillos, opossums, ground sloths)
- Major faunal turnover on both continents

## Significance for Human Evolution

The Pliocene was the crucible of human evolution:

### Hominin Milestones

| Time (Ma) | Event |
|-----------|-------|
| 4.2-3.9 | *Australopithecus anamensis* |
| 3.9-2.9 | *Australopithecus afarensis* ("Lucy") |
| 3.5 | Laetoli footprints - bipedal walking |
| 3.3 | Earliest stone tools? (Lomekwi) |
| 2.8-2.5 | Early *Homo* appears |
| 2.6 | Oldowan stone tools confirmed |
| 2.5-1.5 | *Paranthropus* robust australopiths |

### Evolutionary Pressures

| Environmental Factor | Selective Pressure | Possible Adaptation |
|---------------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Variable climate | Behavioral flexibility | Larger brains |
| Expanding grasslands | Terrestrial locomotion | Improved bipedalism |
| Seasonal resources | Dietary breadth | Tool use, meat eating |
| Predator pressure | Social cooperation | Group living |

## Key Sites

| Site | Age (Ma) | Location | Key Fossils |
|------|----------|----------|-------------|
| Kanapoi | 4.2-4.1 | Kenya | *A. anamensis* |
| Hadar | 3.4-2.9 | Ethiopia | *A. afarensis*, "Lucy" |
| Laetoli | 3.7-3.5 | Tanzania | Footprints, *A. afarensis* |
| Sterkfontein | 3.5-2.5 | South Africa | *A. africanus* |
| Lomekwi | 3.3 | Kenya | Earliest stone tools? |
| Ledi-Geraru | 2.8 | Ethiopia | Earliest *Homo* jaw |
| Olduvai | 2.0-1.5 | Tanzania | *Homo habilis*, tools |
