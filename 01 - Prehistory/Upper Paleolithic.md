# Upper Paleolithic

The Upper Paleolithic (50,000-10,000 years ago) represents a revolutionary period in human prehistory characterized by unprecedented technological innovation, the flourishing of symbolic expression, and the global spread of modern humans. This era witnessed the creation of the first art, the invention of sophisticated tools, and the colonization of every habitable continent.

## Overview

### Definition

| Attribute | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Time range | ~50-10 ka (Europe); variable globally |
| Climate | Glacial and interglacial oscillations |
| Key species | *Homo sapiens* (primarily) |
| Preceding period | Middle Paleolithic |
| Following period | Mesolithic/Epipaleolithic |

### Regional Terminology

| Region | Term | Time Range |
|--------|------|------------|
| Europe | Upper Paleolithic | 45-10 ka |
| Africa | Later Stone Age | 50-10 ka |
| Asia | Upper Paleolithic | 45-10 ka |
| Americas | Paleoindian | 15-10 ka |

## The "Human Revolution"

### Revolutionary Changes

The Upper Paleolithic saw dramatic innovations:

| Innovation | Description |
|------------|-------------|
