# Brain Evolution

The expansion of the human brain is one of the most dramatic evolutionary changes in the history of life. Over approximately 6 million years, hominin brains tripled in size—from ~350 cc in early hominins to ~1,350 cc in modern humans—accompanied by reorganization that enabled language, abstract thought, and complex culture.

## Overview

### Key Statistics

| Species | Age | Brain Size (cc) | Body Mass (kg) |
|---------|-----|-----------------|----------------|
| Chimpanzee | Living | 350-400 | 40-60 |
| *Sahelanthropus* | 7-6 Ma | ~350 | Unknown |
| *Ardipithecus* | 4.4 Ma | 300-350 | ~50 |
| *Australopithecus* | 4-2 Ma | 400-550 | 30-50 |

### Encephalization Quotient (EQ)

Brain size relative to body size:

| Species | EQ |
|---------|-----|
| Average mammal | 1.0 |
| Chimpanzee | 2.5 |
| *Australopithecus* | 2.5-3.0 |
| *Homo erectus* | 3.5-4.5 |
| Modern humans | 7.0-7.5 |

## Phases of Brain Expansion

### Phase 1: Stasis (7-2.5 Ma)

| Period | Brain Size | Notes |
|--------|------------|-------|
| Early hominins | 350-450 cc | No significant increase |
| Australopiths | 400-550 cc | Slight increase |
| Relative to body | Chimp-like EQ | Not exceptional |

### Phase 2: Initial Expansion (2.5-1.8 Ma)

| Event | Change |
|-------|--------|
| Emergence of *Homo* | Jump to 500-700 cc |
| Tool use established | Oldowan industry |
| Meat eating increases | Dietary shift |
| First dispersal | Out of Africa |

### Phase 3: Rapid Expansion (1.8 Ma - 200 ka)

| Species | Brain Size | Rate |
|---------|------------|------|
| *H. erectus* (early) | 600-900 cc | Gradual increase |
| *H. erectus* (late) | 900-1,250 cc | Continued growth |
| *H. heidelbergensis* | 1,100-1,400 cc | Near-modern |
| Neanderthals | 1,200-1,700 cc | Exceeds modern |

### Phase 4: Reorganization (200 ka - present)

| Change | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Size plateau | ~1,350 cc average |
| Recent decrease | Slight reduction in Holocene |
| Reorganization | Internal restructuring |
| Globularization | Rounded skull shape |

## What Got Bigger?

### Brain Regions

| Region | Change | Function |
|--------|--------|----------|
| Prefrontal cortex | Major expansion | Planning, decision-making |
| Temporal lobes | Expansion | Language, memory |
| Parietal lobes | Expansion | Spatial reasoning, tool use |
| Cerebellum | Expansion | Motor control, cognition |
| Broca's area | Reorganization | Speech production |
| Wernicke's area | Reorganization | Language comprehension |

### The Prefrontal Cortex

Disproportionately enlarged in humans:
- Executive function
- Working memory
- Social cognition
- Impulse control
- Future planning

### Language Areas

| Area | Function | Evidence |
|------|----------|----------|
| Broca's area | Speech production | Endocast impressions |
| Wernicke's area | Comprehension | Temporal expansion |
| Arcuate fasciculus | Connects regions | Reorganization |

## Why Did Brains Get Bigger?

### Hypotheses

| Hypothesis | Mechanism | Evidence |
|------------|-----------|----------|
| **Social brain** | Complex social life | Correlation with group size |
| **Ecological intelligence** | Foraging challenges | Tool use, planning |
| **Dietary shift** | Meat eating | Protein for brain growth |
| **Cooking** | Pre-digested food | Energy savings |
| **Climate variability** | Adaptation demands | Correlation with climate |
| **Cultural intelligence** | Cumulative culture | Feedback loop |
| **Sexual selection** | Intelligence as display | Possible |
| **Runaway selection** | Self-reinforcing | Gene-culture coevolution |

### The Expensive Tissue Hypothesis

| Organ | % Body Mass | % Energy Use |
|-------|-------------|--------------|
| Brain | 2% | 20-25% |
| Gut | ~2% | ~15% |

Trade-off: Smaller gut enabled larger brain
- Meat eating = higher quality diet
- Cooking = pre-digestion
- Less gut needed
- Energy freed for brain

### Social Brain Hypothesis

| Evidence | Finding |
|----------|---------|
| Group size correlation | Larger groups = larger neocortex |
| Primate comparisons | Social complexity predicts brain size |
| Human groups | ~150 "Dunbar's number" |
| Social cognition | Theory of mind unique |

## Costs of Large Brains

### Metabolic Costs

| Cost | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Energy | 20-25% of metabolism |
| Glucose | Brain requires constant supply |
| Development | Long maturation period |
| Fat storage | Necessary for brain fuel |

### Developmental Costs

| Cost | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Prolonged childhood | Years of dependency |
| Difficult birth | Large head through pelvis |
| Altricial infants | Born helpless |
| Parental investment | Extended care required |

### Obstetric Dilemma

| Constraint | Effect |
|------------|--------|
| Bipedal pelvis | Narrow birth canal |
| Neonatal brain | 25% of adult size at birth |
| Brain growth | Continues after birth |
| Implication | Helpless infants, long childhood |

## Brain Reorganization

### Not Just Size

| Change | Significance |
|--------|--------------|
| Sulcal patterns | Increased folding |
| White matter | More connections |
| Lateralization | Hemispheric specialization |
| Globular shape | Unique to *sapiens* |

### The Globular Brain

Modern humans have uniquely round brains:

| Feature | Archaic Humans | Modern Humans |
|---------|----------------|---------------|
| Shape | Elongated | Globular |
| Forehead | Sloping | Vertical |
| Parietal | Flatter | Bulging |
| Cerebellum | Less expanded | More expanded |
| Development | Unknown | First year of life |

## Evidence for Cognitive Evolution

|--------|------------------|-------------|
| Stone tools | 3.3-2.6 Ma | Planning, manual skill |
| Acheulean handaxes | 1.76 Ma | Symmetry, mental template |
| Fire control | 1.0 Ma - 400 ka | Planning, cooking |
| Hafted tools | 500-300 ka | Multi-step manufacture |
| Symbolic artifacts | 100-70 ka | Abstract thought |
| Art | 40-30 ka | Symbolic expression |
| Burial | 100-30 ka | Awareness of death |

### Endocasts

| Information | Method |
|-------------|--------|
| Brain size | Volume measurement |
| Surface features | Sulci, gyri impressions |
| Asymmetries | Hemispheric differences |
| Blood vessels | Meningeal patterns |

## Genetics of Brain Evolution

### Key Genes

| Gene | Function | Change |

| *ASPM* | Brain size | Positive selection |
| *Microcephalin* | Brain development | Human-specific changes |
| *FOXP2* | Language | Human variant |
| *HAR1* | Brain development | Fastest-evolving region |
| *SRGAP2* | Neuron development | Duplicated in humans |

### Human Accelerated Regions (HARs)

- DNA sequences conserved in mammals
- Rapidly evolved in humans
- Many associated with brain development
- ~50 HARs identified

## Comparison with Other Species

| Species | Brain (cc) | Notable Abilities |
|---------|------------|-------------------|
| Bottlenose dolphin | 1,500-1,700 | Social cognition |
| Elephant | 4,000-5,000 | Memory, empathy |
| Chimpanzee | 350-400 | Tool use, culture |
| Crow | 10 | Problem-solving |
| Human | 1,350 | Language, abstract thought |

Brain size alone doesn't determine intelligence; organization matters.
