# Acheulean Industry

The Acheulean is the longest-lasting stone tool tradition in human history, persisting for over 1.5 million years. Characterized by the distinctive handaxe (biface), this technology demonstrates increased cognitive sophistication, planning depth, and standardization compared to the earlier Oldowan.

## Technology

### The Handaxe

The signature Acheulean tool:

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Form | Bifacially flaked, teardrop or ovate shape |
| Size | 8-30 cm typical |
| Cross-section | Biconvex or plano-convex |
| Edge | Continuous working edge around perimeter |
| Symmetry | Often bilaterally symmetrical |
| Shaping | Extensive, reducing original form |

### Manufacturing Stages

**1. Blank Selection/Production:**
- Large flake from boulder
- Or cobble/slab selection

**2. Initial Shaping (Roughing Out):**
- Hard hammer percussion
- Establish basic form
- Remove major irregularities

**3. Thinning:**
- Remove flakes across surface
- Reduce thickness
- Improve symmetry

**4. Finishing:**
- Soft hammer (bone, antler, wood)
- Refine edge
- Final shaping

### Other Acheulean Tools

| Tool Type | Description | Function |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| Cleaver | Handaxe with transverse edge | Heavy chopping |
| Pick | Thick, pointed tool | Digging |
| Knife | Elongated cutting tool | Butchery |
| Scraper | Edge-modified flake | Hide/wood working |
| Spheroid | Shaped stone ball | Unknown (percussion?) |

### Reduction Techniques

| Technique | Description | Period |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| Hard hammer | Stone on stone | Throughout |
| Soft hammer | Bone/antler/wood on stone | Later Acheulean |
| Platform preparation | Controlled flake removal | Later Acheulean |
| Pressure flaking | Rare before Upper Paleolithic | Terminal |

## Origins and Development

### First Appearance

**Kokiselei 4, Kenya (1.76 Ma):**
- Oldest confirmed Acheulean
- West Turkana
- Handaxes and picks
- Shows early standardization

### Development Through Time

| Phase | Time | Characteristics |
|-------|------|-----------------|
| Early Acheulean | 1.76-1.0 Ma | Thick, asymmetric handaxes |
| Middle Acheulean | 1.0-0.5 Ma | Thinner, more symmetrical |
| Late Acheulean | 500-200 ka | Refined, soft hammer finish |

### Regional Variation

| Region | Characteristics |
|--------|-----------------|
| Africa | Cleavers common; large forms |
| Europe | Refined, often smaller |
| Levant | Variable; transitional forms |
| India | Large, crude to refined |

## The Movius Line

### Definition
A hypothetical boundary dividing the Old World:
- West: Acheulean handaxe tradition
- East: Chopping tool/flake traditions

### Proposed Boundary
Running from northern India through East/Southeast Asia

### Explanations

| Hypothesis | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| Bamboo hypothesis | Organic tools replaced stone in East Asia |
| Multiple dispersals | Different populations, different traditions |
| Raw material | Lack of suitable stone in East Asia |
| Cultural boundary | Real technological divide |
| Sampling bias | Acheulean present but not found |

### Current Status
Recent finds challenge a strict line:
- Acheulean found in China (Bose Basin)
- Some handaxes in Korea
- Line may be more porous than thought

## Function

### Use-Wear and Residue Evidence

| Analysis | Finding |
|----------|---------|
| Microwear | Edge damage from meat, wood, plants |
| Residues | Animal tissue, plant material |
| Experiments | Effective for butchery |

### Proposed Functions

| Function | Evidence |
|----------|----------|
| Butchery | Cut marks, kill sites, use-wear |
| Woodworking | Use-wear, Schöningen spears |
| Digging | Picks, tuber association |
| Display | Symmetry beyond functional need? |
| Thrown projectile | Aerodynamic properties |

### The "Sexy Handaxe" Hypothesis

Kohn and Mithen proposed:
- Handaxes as sexual display
- Symmetry signals fitness
- Beyond utilitarian need
- Controversial but stimulating

## Cognitive Implications

### What Handaxes Tell Us

| Capacity | Evidence |
|----------|----------|
| Mental template | Standardized form |
| Planning | Multi-stage production |
| Symmetry perception | Bilateral matching |
| Fine motor control | Precise flaking |
| Teaching/learning | Consistent tradition |
| Delayed gratification | Long production time |

### Comparison to Oldowan

| Feature | Oldowan | Acheulean |
|---------|---------|-----------|
| Planning depth | Limited | Extended |
| Standardization | Low | High |
| Shaping intensity | Minimal | Extensive |
| Symmetry | Absent | Often present |
| Cognitive demand | Moderate | High |

|---------|-----------|-------------------|
| Key tool | Handaxe | Point, scraper |

| Blank production | Integrated | Separate |

### Possible Causes
- New cognitive abilities
- Hunting innovations (hafting, projectiles)
- Social changes
- Climate pressures
