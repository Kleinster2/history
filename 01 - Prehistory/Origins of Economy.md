# Origins of Economy

Economy—the allocation of scarce resources to meet needs—is often treated as a product of civilization. But economic behavior began over 2.5 million years ago with the first stone tools. The Oldowan industry marks the birth of investment thinking, delayed gratification, and resource planning that would eventually produce temples, trade networks, and markets.

## What Is Economy?

### Core Definition

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Economy | Allocating scarce resources to meet needs |
| Scarcity | Resources are limited |
| Allocation | Choices about use |
| Investment | Spend now, benefit later |
| Trade | Exchange for mutual benefit |

### Economic Behaviors

| Behavior | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Production | Making useful things |
| Exchange | Trading goods/services |
| Storage | Saving for future |
| Investment | Current cost for future gain |
| Specialization | Division of labor |

## The Birth of Economy: Oldowan (2.6 Ma)

### Why Oldowan = Economic Revolution

The [[Oldowan Industry]] represents the first systematic economic behavior:

| Principle | Oldowan Expression |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Delayed gratification | Spend effort now, benefit later |
| Investment thinking | Make tool today, use for months |
| Resource planning | Transport stone for future needs |
| Human capital | Skills learned, taught, accumulated |
| Quality seeking | Choose better raw materials |

### What Makes Humans Unique

| Species | Economic Behavior |
|---------|-------------------|
| Other animals | Immediate returns only |
| Chimpanzees | Simple tools, no accumulation |
| Early hominins (pre-Oldowan) | Like other animals |
| Oldowan hominins | First systematic investment |
| Modern humans | Complex economies |

**The threshold:** Before Oldowan, hominins lived like other animals—no stored technology, no delayed returns. After Oldowan, we became the only species that systematically invests in tools, skills, and resources for future benefit.

## The Economic Feedback Loop

### The Engine of Human Evolution

```
Better tools → More meat/marrow → More calories
     ↑                                    ↓
     └──── Larger brains ←────────────────┘
```

| Stage | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| Tools unlock food | High-quality calories accessible |
| Calories fuel brains | Brain expansion possible |
| Larger brains | Better tool-making, planning |
| Better tools | Even more food accessible |

This feedback loop drove human evolution for 2+ million years.

### Acceleration Over Time

| Period | Economic Capability |
|--------|---------------------|
| Oldowan (2.6 Ma) | Basic investment, transport |
| Acheulean (1.7 Ma) | Standardized production |
| Middle Paleolithic (300 ka) | Composite tools, hafting |
| Upper Paleolithic (50 ka) | Trade networks, specialization |
| Neolithic (12 ka) | Surplus, property, markets |
| Bronze Age (5 ka) | Complex economies, writing |

## Sharing and Cooperation

### Food Sharing as Proto-Economy

| Feature | Economic Function |
|---------|-------------------|
| Meat sharing | Redistribution of windfalls |
| Risk pooling | Bad hunter today, good tomorrow |
| Reciprocity | I share now, you share later |
| Reputation | Good sharers get more partners |

### Why Share?

Hunting is high-variance: success is unpredictable. Sharing smooths out the variance.

| Strategy | Outcome |
|----------|---------|
| Keep all | Feast or famine |
| Share | Steady supply |
| Calculation | Sharing wins over time |

### Reciprocity Systems

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Direct reciprocity | I help you, you help me |
| Indirect reciprocity | I help you, someone helps me (reputation) |
| Generalized reciprocity | Share freely within group |
| Balanced reciprocity | Tit-for-tat exchanges |

### Cooperative Hunting

| Challenge | Economic Solution |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Large prey | Requires multiple hunters |
| Division of kill | Sharing rules |
| Free riders | Social punishment |
| Coordination | Communication, planning |

## Division of Labor

### Sexual Division of Labor

| Evidence | Interpretation |
|----------|----------------|
| Ethnographic universals | Men hunt large game, women gather/process |
| Skeletal markers | Different activity patterns |
| Tool associations | Some tools sex-linked? |
| Timing | Debated—possibly very early |

### The Grandmother Hypothesis

| Concept | Economic Implication |
|---------|---------------------|
| Post-reproductive females | Unique to humans |
| Grandmother provisioning | Feed grandchildren |
| Economic contribution | Productive beyond reproduction |
| Knowledge transfer | Skills, plant knowledge |

### Male Provisioning

| Behavior | Economic Function |
|----------|-------------------|
| Pair bonding | Long-term investment |
| Male hunting | Provision female + offspring |
| Paternal care | Unusual among primates |
| Economic partnership | Division of labor within pair |

### Age-Based Roles

| Age | Economic Contribution |
|-----|----------------------|
| Children | Learning, some gathering |
| Young adults | Peak hunting/foraging |
| Middle age | Teaching, skilled tasks |
| Elders | Knowledge, childcare |

## Cognitive Adaptations for Economy

### Cheater Detection

Humans are wired to spot unfair exchanges:

| Adaptation | Function |
|------------|----------|
| Wason selection task | We excel at detecting cheaters |
| Moral emotions | Anger at unfairness |
| Gossip | Reputation tracking |
| Punishment | Costly to punish, but deters cheating |

### Mental Accounting

| Ability | Economic Function |
|---------|-------------------|
| Tracking debts | Who owes what |
| Counting | Quantities, fairness |
| Memory for exchanges | Long-term reciprocity |
| Inequality aversion | Resist unfair deals |

### Theory of Mind

| Ability | Economic Use |
|---------|--------------|
| Inferring intentions | Is this a fair offer? |
| Predicting behavior | Will they reciprocate? |
| Deception detection | Spotting bad deals |
| Perspective-taking | Understanding others' needs |

### Numeracy

| Stage | Evidence |
|-------|----------|
| Approximate number sense | All primates |
| Exact small numbers | Early humans |
| Counting systems | Upper Paleolithic tallies? |
| Abstract numeracy | With language |

## Property and Ownership

### When Did "Mine" Emerge?

| Stage | Property Concept |
|-------|------------------|
| Primate | Possession (current holding) |
| Early hominin | Tool ownership? |
| Upper Paleolithic | Personal ornaments, caches |
| Neolithic | Land, stored food, herds |

### Evidence for Early Property

| Evidence | Interpretation |
|----------|----------------|
| Tool caches | Hidden for future use = ownership |
| Grave goods | Personal possessions |
| Ornaments | Individual identity markers |
| Territorial behavior | Group property |

### Territoriality

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Home range | Area used by group |
| Core territory | Defended resources |
| Boundary marking | Signals to others |
| Intergroup conflict | Resource competition |

### Property Rights Evolution

| Stage | Property Form |
|-------|---------------|
| Mobile foragers | Minimal, portable goods |
| Complex foragers | Stored resources, sites |
| Early farmers | Land ownership emerges |
| States | Codified property law |

## Risk Management

### Storage as Insurance

| Strategy | Function |
|----------|----------|
| Food caching | Buffer against scarcity |
| Tool caches | Resources when needed |
| Dried/smoked food | Long-term storage |
| Fat storage (body) | Biological insurance |

### Sharing Networks as Safety Net

| Mechanism | Function |
|-----------|----------|
| Wide sharing | More people owe you |
| Alliance maintenance | Insurance network |
| Gift giving | Creates obligations |
| Mobility | Can move to allies in crisis |

### Seasonal Planning

| Challenge | Solution |
|-----------|----------|
| Lean seasons | Storage, migration |
| Predictable scarcity | Planning, preparation |
| Unpredictable events | Social insurance |
| Climate variation | Flexible strategies |

### Diversification

| Strategy | Benefit |
|----------|---------|
| Broad diet | No single point of failure |
| Multiple territories | Resource backup |
| Trade partnerships | Access to distant resources |
| Skill variety | Multiple ways to contribute |

## Social Exchange

### Grooming as Currency (Primate Background)

| Behavior | Economic Parallel |
|----------|-------------------|
| Grooming time | Payment |
| Grooming reciprocity | Exchange |
| Grooming coalitions | Alliances |
| Grooming for support | Service trade |

### Alliance Building

| Investment | Return |
|------------|--------|
| Time with allies | Support when needed |
| Gift giving | Obligation created |
| Information sharing | Reciprocal intel |
| Joint activities | Bonding, trust |

### Costly Signaling

| Signal | Message |
|--------|---------|
| Generous sharing | "I'm successful, good partner" |
| Risky hunting | "I'm skilled, brave" |
| Elaborate ornaments | "I have surplus time/resources" |
| Public feasts | "I'm wealthy, ally with me" |

### Prestige and Status

| Status Type | Economic Implications |
|-------------|----------------------|
| Dominance | Take by force |
| Prestige | Given by others for value |
| Skilled hunter | More mating, alliance offers |
| Knowledge holder | Consulted, rewarded |

## After the Origins: Divergent Paths

### The Key Insight

After the shared prehistoric origins (tools, fire, trade, agriculture, cities), human economies **diverged** into radically different systems. There was no single ladder of economic evolution—different civilizations made different choices, and many worked.

### The Fork in the Road (~3000 BCE onward)

| Civilization | Economic System | Money? | Markets? |
|--------------|-----------------|--------|----------|
| Mesopotamia | Temple/palace + markets | Silver weights | Yes |
| Egypt | State redistribution | Limited | Limited |
| Indus Valley | ??? (standardization without visible rulers) | No coins | Probably |
| China | State intervention + markets | Yes (independent) | Yes |
| Greece | Commercial polis | Coinage | Central |
| Rome | Slave economy + trade | Denarius | Yes |
| Persia | Tribute empire | Darics | Yes |
| Inca | State redistribution | **None** | **None** |
| Aztec | Tribute + markets | Cacao, cloth | Yes (huge) |

### What This Shows

| Assumption | Evidence Against |
|------------|------------------|
| Money is universal | Inca had none |
| Markets are natural | Inca operated without |
| One path to complexity | Multiple paths worked |
| Western model is the model | China, Inca, others differed |

### Different Solutions to the Same Problems

**Problem: How to allocate goods?**

| Solution | Example |
|----------|---------|
| Markets | Greece, Aztec |
| State redistribution | Egypt, Inca |
| Temple redistribution | Mesopotamia (early) |
| Tribute extraction | Persia, Aztec |
| Hybrid systems | Most civilizations |

**Problem: How to store value?**

| Solution | Example |
|----------|---------|
| Metal coins | Greece, Rome, China, Persia |
| Commodity money | Aztec (cacao), Mesopotamia (silver) |
| State storehouses | Inca, Egypt |
| Textiles | Inca, Aztec |
| Nothing needed | Inca redistribution |

**Problem: How to mobilize labor?**

| Solution | Example |
|----------|---------|
| Slavery | Greece, Rome |
| Corvee | Egypt, China |
| Mit'a (rotational) | Inca |
| Wage labor | Some everywhere |
| Serfdom | Sparta (helots) |

### The "Economy Without Money" Test Case

The Inca Empire proves that large-scale economic coordination is possible without money or markets:

| Inca Feature | Implication |
|--------------|-------------|
| 12 million people | Scale doesn't require money |
| 40,000 km roads | Infrastructure without markets |
| Complex administration | Records without writing (khipu) |
| Specialized production | Division of labor without prices |
| Lasted ~100 years | System was stable (until conquest) |

See: [[Inca Empire]], [[Pre-Columbian Economy]]

### What Varied, What Didn't

**Universal features** (from prehistoric origins):

| Feature | Found Everywhere |
|---------|------------------|
| Investment thinking | Yes |
| Specialization | Yes |
| Storage/surplus | Yes |
| Record keeping | Yes (even khipu) |
| Trade/exchange of some kind | Yes |

**Variable features** (civilizational choices):

| Feature | Varied |
|---------|--------|
| Coinage | Some yes, some no |
| Markets | Some yes, some no |
| State role | Very different |
| Labor systems | Highly varied |
| Property rights | Diverse concepts |

### Implications for Understanding Economy

| Lesson | Elaboration |
|--------|-------------|
| Origins are shared | All economies trace to Oldowan investment thinking |
| Paths diverge | Different civilizations made different choices |
| Multiple equilibria | Many systems can "work" |
| Context matters | Geography, ideology, history shaped choices |
| Our system isn't inevitable | Modern capitalism is one path, not the only one |

## Economic Principles Through Time

### Investment Thinking

| Period | Investment Form |
|--------|-----------------|
| Oldowan | Make tool for future use |
| Neolithic | Plant seeds, wait for harvest |
| Bronze Age | Build irrigation, temples |
| Modern | Capital investment |

Same principle across 2.6 million years.

### Delayed Gratification

| Period | Example |
|--------|---------|
| Oldowan | Walk km to find good stone |
| Upper Paleolithic | Spend hours making beads |
| Neolithic | Wait months for crops |
| Urban | Years building monuments |

### Specialization

| Period | Division of Labor |
|--------|-------------------|
| Oldowan | Possibly some task division |
| Upper Paleolithic | Specialist knappers |
| Neolithic | Potters, weavers |
| Urban | Scribes, priests, merchants |

### Storage and Surplus

| Period | Storage Form |
|--------|--------------|
| Oldowan | Tool caches |
| Upper Paleolithic | Food pits, caches |
| Neolithic | Granaries |
| Urban | Treasuries, warehouses |

## Why Economy Preceded Civilization

Traditional view: Cities → surplus → economy

Evidence shows: Economy → surplus → cities

| Stage | Development |
|-------|-------------|
| 2.6 Ma | Investment thinking (Oldowan) |
| 50 ka | Trade networks (Upper Paleolithic) |
| 12 ka | Surplus production (Neolithic) |
| 10 ka | Monumental construction ([[Gobekli Tepe]]) |
| 5 ka | Cities, writing ([[Uruk]]) |

Economic behavior is not a product of civilization—it is a prerequisite for it.

## The Continuity of Economic Principles

| Ancient Practice | Modern Equivalent |
|------------------|-------------------|
| Oldowan raw material selection | Mining industry |
| Tool caching | Savings, inventory |
| Skill transmission | Education, training |
| Upper Paleolithic trade | Global commerce |
| Neolithic storage | Banking |
| Temple redistribution | Taxation, welfare |
| Cuneiform records | Accounting |

Every modern economic institution has roots extending millions of years.
