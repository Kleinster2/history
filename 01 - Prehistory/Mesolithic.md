# Mesolithic

The Mesolithic ("Middle Stone Age")—the period between the Upper Paleolithic and Neolithic—saw hunter-gatherers adapt to post-[[Ice Age]] environments before adopting agriculture. Mesolithic peoples developed new technologies (microliths, fishing gear, boats), exploited diverse resources, and in some regions achieved sedentism without farming. The Mesolithic bridges the Paleolithic world of ice-age hunters and the Neolithic agricultural revolution.

## Overview

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Period | ~15,000-5,000 BCE (varies by region) |
| Character | Post-glacial hunter-gatherers |
| Environment | [[Holocene Epoch]] warming |
| Technology | Microliths, composite tools |
| End | Adoption of agriculture |

## Chronology

### Regional Variation

| Region | Period |
|--------|--------|
| Near East | ~15,000-10,000 BCE |
| Europe | ~10,000-5,000 BCE |
| Northern Europe | Longer duration |
| Elsewhere | Term rarely used |

### Transition Points

| Transition | Character |
|------------|-----------|
| From Paleolithic | Climate change |
| To Neolithic | Agriculture adoption |
| Duration | Variable by region |

## Environmental Context

### Post-Glacial Changes

| Change | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Warming | Forests expand |
| Sea level | Rising, coastlines change |
| Fauna | Megafauna gone, new species |
| Flora | Forest replaces tundra |

### New Resources

| Resource | Character |
|----------|-----------|
| Forest game | Deer, boar |
| Fish | Rivers, coasts |
| Shellfish | Coastal exploitation |
| Plant foods | Nuts, seeds, fruits |

## Technology

### Microliths

| Feature | Character |
|---------|-----------|
| Definition | Small stone blades |
| Function | Composite tool parts |
| Hafting | Set in wood, bone |
| Uses | Arrows, harpoons, sickles |

### Fishing and Maritime

| Innovation | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| Fishhooks | Angling |
| Nets | Mass capture |
| Boats | Dugouts, skin boats |
| Harpoons | Marine hunting |

### Other Tools

| Tool | Function |
|------|----------|
| Axes | Woodworking, deforestation |
| Adzes | Boat making |
| Grinding stones | Plant processing |
| Traps | Animal capture |

## Subsistence

### Broad Spectrum

| Strategy | Character |
|----------|-----------|
| Diverse diet | Many food sources |
| Seasonal round | Following resources |
| Storage | Some preserved foods |
| Intensification | More labor, more yield |

### Regional Specialization

| Region | Focus |
|--------|-------|
| Coastal | Marine resources |
| Riverine | Fish, waterfowl |
| Forest | Game, nuts |
| Lake margins | Diverse |

## Settlement

### Sedentism

| Pattern | Character |
|---------|-----------|
| Base camps | More permanent |
| Seasonal | Some movement |
| Rich environments | Year-round occupation |
| Examples | Natufian, Ertebølle |

### Site Types

| Type | Function |
|------|----------|
| Shell middens | Coastal accumulation |
| Pit houses | Semi-permanent |
| Open camps | Temporary |
| Cemeteries | Ritual, territory |

## Key Cultures

### Near East

| Culture | Character |
|---------|-----------|
| Natufian | Sedentary foragers |
| Date | ~15,000-11,500 BCE |
| Location | Levant |
| Significance | Pre-agricultural sedentism |

### Europe

| Culture | Location |
|---------|----------|
| Maglemosian | Northern Europe |
| Ertebølle | Scandinavia |
| Tardenoisian | Western Europe |
| Star Carr | Britain |

## Social Organization

### Group Size

| Feature | Character |
|---------|-----------|
| Larger | Than Paleolithic |
| Aggregation | Seasonal gatherings |
| Territories | More defined |
| Population | Growing |

### Complexity

| Development | Evidence |
|-------------|----------|
| Burials | Elaborate some places |
| Cemeteries | Group identity |
| Art | Continued |
| Trade | Exchange networks |

## Transition to Neolithic

### Adoption of Agriculture

| Pattern | Character |
|---------|-----------|
| Near East | Indigenous development |
| Europe | Migration and adoption |
| Resistance | Some groups delayed |
| Coexistence | Farmers and foragers |

### Why Transition?

| Factor | Role |
|--------|------|
| Population pressure | Maybe |
| Climate | Stable Holocene |
| Contact | With farmers |
| Choice | Variable |
