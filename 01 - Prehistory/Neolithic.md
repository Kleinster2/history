# Neolithic

The agricultural revolution that made everything else possible. Beginning around 10,000 BCE, humans in several regions independently transitioned from foraging to farming—the most consequential economic transformation until industrialization.

## Definition

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Meaning | "New Stone Age" |
| Dates | ~10,000-3000 BCE (varies by region) |
| Defining change | Shift to food production |
| Key innovations | Domestication, sedentism, pottery |

## Multiple Independent Origins

| Region | Date | Crops/Animals |
|--------|------|---------------|
| Fertile Crescent | ~10,000 BCE | Wheat, barley, sheep, goats |
| China (Yellow River) | ~8,000 BCE | Millet, pigs |
| China (Yangtze) | ~8,000 BCE | Rice |
| New Guinea | ~7,000 BCE | Taro, bananas |
| Mesoamerica | ~5,000 BCE | Maize, beans, squash |
| Andes | ~5,000 BCE | Potatoes, llamas |
| Sub-Saharan Africa | ~3,000 BCE | Sorghum, millet |

## What Changed

### From Foraging to Farming

| Foraging | Farming |
|----------|---------|
| Mobility | Sedentism |
| Immediate consumption | Storage, surplus |
| Band organization | Village organization |
| Egalitarian | Hierarchical |
| Common access | Property claims |

### Economic Consequences

| Change | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Surplus | Enables non-food producers |
| Storage | Requires property concepts |
| Sedentism | Investment in place |
| Population growth | Labor supply, pressure |
| Specialization | Division of labor begins |

## The Neolithic Package

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Domesticated plants | Selectively bred for yield |
| Domesticated animals | Labor, food, materials |
| Villages | Permanent settlements |
| Pottery | Storage technology |
| Ground stone tools | Agricultural implements |
| Weaving | Textile production |

## Why Agriculture?

### Theories

| Theory | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| Population pressure | More mouths to feed |
| Climate change | End of Ice Age, new opportunities |
| Sedentism first | Stayed put, then farmed |
| Social competition | Feasting drove surplus |
| Accident | Gradual, unintended |

### The Paradox

| Observation | Implication |
|-------------|-------------|
| Early farmers worked harder | Not labor-saving |
| Nutrition declined | Not health-improving |
| Inequality increased | Not welfare-enhancing |
| Yet it spread | Must have some advantage |

The advantage: population growth. Farmers outbred foragers, even if individuals were worse off.

## Consequences

### Immediate

| Change | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Villages | Social complexity |
| Property | Inheritance, accumulation |
| Surplus | Elites, specialization |
| Labor | Intensive work regimes |

### Long-term

| Development | Foundation |
|-------------|------------|
| Cities | Agricultural surplus |
| States | Control of surplus |
| Writing | Record-keeping |
| Inequality | Differential accumulation |
| [[Institutions and Progress\|Institutions]] | Channeling ambition |

## Regional Variations

### Fertile Crescent

| Feature | Character |
|---------|-----------|
| Earliest | ~10,000 BCE |
| Package | Wheat, barley, sheep, goats, cattle |
| Spread | To Europe, Egypt, India |
| Why here? | Wild ancestors present, climate |

### East Asia

| Feature | Character |
|---------|-----------|
| Independent | Not derived from West |
| Rice | Yangtze, paddy cultivation |
| Millet | Yellow River, dry farming |
| Spread | To Japan, Southeast Asia |

### Americas

| Feature | Character |
|---------|-----------|
| Late start | ~5000 BCE |
| Different crops | Maize, beans, squash |
| Few animals | No large domesticates except llama |
| Consequences | Limited animal power, transport |

## The Deeper Point

The Neolithic was the first great channeling of human ambition. For millions of years, hominins lived in the present—finding food, consuming it, moving on. Agriculture required a different orientation: planting now, harvesting later, storing for the future, defending accumulated surplus.

This shift created the [[Property Rights|property]] concept. When you invest labor in land and wait months for returns, you need assurance that the harvest will be yours. When you store grain, you need protection from theft. The institutions that emerged—villages, chiefs, eventually states—existed partly to solve these new coordination problems.

The Neolithic also created inequality. Foragers had little to accumulate; farmers could pile up surplus. Some families got more, passed it to children, and inequality compounded across generations. The egalitarian band gave way to the stratified society.

Every subsequent economic transformation—cities, states, markets, industry—built on this Neolithic foundation. The questions that define economic history—who produces, who accumulates, who rules—first became pressing when humans started farming. The Neolithic didn't just change how people ate. It changed what people could want.
