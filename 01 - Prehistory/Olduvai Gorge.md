# Olduvai Gorge

Olduvai Gorge is the most famous paleoanthropological site in the world—a 48-kilometer ravine in Tanzania's Serengeti Plain that has yielded a nearly continuous record of human evolution spanning 2 million years. Excavated primarily by Louis and Mary Leakey, Olduvai has produced iconic fossils and defined major stone tool industries.

## Overview

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Location | Northern Tanzania, Ngorongoro Conservation Area |
| Type | Exposed lake-margin sediments |
| Age range | ~2.0 Ma to ~15,000 years |
| Length | ~48 km |
| Depth | Up to 90 m |
| Discovered | 1911 (Wilhelm Kattwinkel) |
| Major excavators | Louis and Mary Leakey |
| UNESCO status | World Heritage Site (Ngorongoro) |

### Etymology

- Maasai name: **Oldupai** (referring to wild sisal plant)
- German/English corruption: "Olduvai"
- Also spelled: Oldoway (historical)

## Geology

### Formation

| Process | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Lake basin | Ancient lake system |
| Sedimentation | 2+ Ma of deposits |
| Volcanism | Ash layers for dating |
| Rift valley | Faulting and uplift |
| Erosion | River cut the gorge ~500 ka |
| Exposure | Revealed fossil beds |

### Stratigraphy

The gorge exposes seven major geological units (beds):

| Bed | Age (Ma) | Characteristics | Key Fossils |
|-----|----------|-----------------|-------------|
| Bed I | 2.0-1.75 | Lake margin, lava | OH 5, OH 7, Oldowan |
| Bed II | 1.75-1.2 | Lake shrinking | OH 9, Acheulean begins |
| Bed III | 1.2-0.8 | Dry conditions | Limited fossils |
| Bed IV | 0.8-0.6 | Renewed lake | Acheulean |
| Masek Beds | 0.6-0.4 | Ash deposits | |
| Ndutu Beds | 0.4-0.032 | Varied | Modern humans |
