# Tool Use

Tool use is one of humanity's defining characteristics, extending our physical capabilities far beyond our biological limits. Beginning at least 3.3 million years ago with simple stone flakes, hominin technology evolved through increasingly sophisticated stages, culminating in the complex material culture that defines our species.
