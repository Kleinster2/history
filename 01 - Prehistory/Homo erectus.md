# Homo erectus

*Homo erectus* was the first hominin to look recognizably human—tall, long-legged, and built for endurance walking. This species was also the first to leave Africa, spreading across Asia and possibly Europe. *H. erectus* controlled fire, made sophisticated tools, and persisted for nearly two million years—making it the most successful hominin species ever in terms of longevity.

## Overview

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Species | *Homo erectus* |
| Time | ~1.9 million - 110,000 years ago |
| Range | Africa, Asia, possibly Europe |
| Brain size | 600-1100 cc |
| Significance | First global hominin |

## Key Fossils

| Fossil | Location | Age |
|--------|----------|-----|
| Turkana Boy | Kenya | 1.5 Ma |
| Java Man | Indonesia | 1+ Ma |
| Peking Man | China | 750-200 ka |
| Dmanisi | Georgia | 1.8 Ma |

### Turkana Boy (KNM-WT 15000)

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Discovery | 1984, Lake Turkana |
| Age at death | ~8-11 years |
| Height (projected) | ~185 cm adult |
| Significance | Most complete early human |

## Anatomy

### Body Plan

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Height | Tall (up to 185 cm) |
| Build | Linear, tropical-adapted |
| Legs | Long, efficient walking |
| Arms | Shorter than earlier hominins |
| Body | Modern proportions |

### Skull

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Braincase | Long, low |
| Brow ridges | Prominent |
| Face | Projecting |
| Brain | 600-1100 cc |
| Teeth | Reduced from earlier hominins |

## Adaptations

### Built for Walking

| Feature | Advantage |
|---------|-----------|
| Long legs | Efficient locomotion |
| Narrow pelvis | Energy-efficient |
| Arched foot | Shock absorption |
| Result | Could cover long distances |

### Thermoregulation

| Feature | Advantage |
|---------|-----------|
| Tall, linear | Heat dissipation |
| Less hair (inferred) | Sweating |
| Nose shape | Air cooling |
| Midday activity | Could hunt in heat |

## Technology

### Acheulean Industry

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Tool type | Handaxes, cleavers |
| Period | 1.76 Ma - 200 ka |
| Advance | Bifacial, symmetrical |
| Spread | Africa, Europe, parts of Asia |

### Fire Use

| Evidence | Status |
|----------|--------|
| Controlled fire | From ~1 Ma (debated) |
| Clear evidence | By 400 ka |
| Implications | Cooking, warmth, protection |
| Cooking hypothesis | May explain brain growth |

## Geographic Spread

### Out of Africa

| Region | Earliest Evidence |
|--------|-------------------|
| Africa | 1.9 Ma |
| Caucasus (Dmanisi) | 1.8 Ma |
| Java | 1.5+ Ma |
| China | 1.6+ Ma |
| Europe | Debated |

### Regional Variants

| Region | Name Sometimes Used |
|--------|---------------------|
| Africa | *H. ergaster* |
| Java | *H. erectus* (sensu stricto) |
| China | *H. erectus pekinensis* |
| Status | One species or several? |

## Behavior

### Hunting

| Evidence | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Butchery sites | Cut marks on bones |
| Persistence hunting | Inferred from anatomy |
| Large prey | Elephants, other megafauna |
| Coordination | Social hunting |

### Social Life

| Inference | Evidence |
|-----------|----------|
| Group living | Likely |
| Care for injured | Dmanisi individuals |
| Division of labor | Possible |
| Language | Debated (likely limited) |

## Significance

| Achievement | Importance |
|-------------|------------|
| First dispersal | Humans became global |
| Fire control | Transformed diet, society |
| Tool tradition | Acheulean persisted 1.5+ Ma |
| Longevity | ~1.8 million years |
