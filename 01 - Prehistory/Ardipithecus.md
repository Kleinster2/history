# Ardipithecus

Ardipithecus represents some of the earliest known hominins—ancient human relatives living near the split between the human and chimpanzee lineages. "Ardi," the famous skeleton of *Ardipithecus ramidus*, transformed our understanding of early human evolution, revealing that our ancestors did not evolve from chimpanzee-like creatures but from something different entirely.

## Overview

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Genus | Ardipithecus |
| Species | *A. ramidus*, *A. kadabba* |
| Time | 5.8-4.2 million years ago |
| Location | Ethiopia |
| Significance | Earliest well-known hominins |

## Species

### Ardipithecus kadabba

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Age | 5.8-5.2 Ma |
| Location | Middle Awash, Ethiopia |
| Fossils | Fragmentary |
| Status | Possibly bipedal |

### Ardipithecus ramidus

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Age | 4.4 Ma |
| Location | Aramis, Ethiopia |
| Key fossil | "Ardi" (ARA-VP-6/500) |
| Completeness | ~45% of skeleton |

## Ardi: The Skeleton

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Discovery | 1994 (published 2009) |
| Age | 4.4 million years |
| Sex | Female |
| Brain size | ~300-350 cc (chimp-sized) |
| Height | ~120 cm |

## Anatomy

### Bipedalism

| Feature | Interpretation |
|---------|---------------|
| Pelvis | Adapted for upright walking |
| Foot | Big toe divergent (grasping) |
| Mix | Bipedal on ground, climbed trees |
| Implication | Not fully committed biped |

### Other Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Arms | Long, for climbing |
| Hands | Less specialized than chimps |
| Teeth | Reduced canines |
| Face | Projecting, ape-like |

## Environment

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Habitat | Woodland, forest |
| Not savanna | Challenges old theories |
| Diet | Probably omnivorous |
| Locomotion | Mixed: walking and climbing |

## Significance

| Discovery | Implication |
|-----------|-------------|
| No knuckle-walking | Humans didn't evolve from chimp-like ancestor |
| Woodland biped | Bipedalism not savanna adaptation |
| Mosaic evolution | Different traits evolved separately |
| Last common ancestor | Probably unlike modern apes |
