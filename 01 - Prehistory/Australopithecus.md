# Australopithecus

*Australopithecus* ("southern ape") represents the first major adaptive radiation of hominins. These bipedal apes lived in Africa from approximately 4.2 to 2 million years ago, bridging the gap between the earliest hominins (*Ardipithecus*) and the genus *Homo*. They walked upright, had small brains, and may have used simple tools.

## Overview

### Defining Characteristics

| Feature | Condition |
|---------|-----------|
| Locomotion | Obligate bipedalism |
| Brain size | 400-550 cc (chimp-sized to slightly larger) |
| Teeth | Large molars, thick enamel, reduced canines |
| Body size | 1.0-1.5 m tall; significant sexual dimorphism |
| Diet | Omnivorous, emphasis on hard/tough plant foods |
| Geographic range | East and South Africa |
| Temporal range | 4.2-2.0 Ma |

### Taxonomy

The genus *Australopithecus* is divided into "gracile" species:

| Species | Age (Ma) | Location | Key Features |
|---------|----------|----------|--------------|
| *A. anamensis* | 4.2-3.9 | Kenya, Ethiopia | Most primitive |
| *A. afarensis* | 3.9-2.9 | Ethiopia, Tanzania, Kenya | "Lucy"; best known |
| *A. bahrelghazali* | 3.5-3.0 | Chad | Extends range westward |
| *A. deyiremeda* | 3.5-3.3 | Ethiopia | Contemporary with *afarensis* |
| *A. africanus* | 3.3-2.1 | South Africa | "Taung Child" |
| *A. garhi* | 2.5 | Ethiopia | Associated with tools? |
| *A. sediba* | 2.0-1.9 | South Africa | *Homo*-like features |

## Australopithecus anamensis (4.2-3.9 Ma)

### Discovery
- First described: 1995 by Meave Leakey and colleagues
- Key sites: Kanapoi, Allia Bay (Kenya); Asa Issie (Ethiopia)

### Anatomy

| Feature | Condition |
|---------|-----------|
| Canines | Larger than later species, but reduced from apes |
| Molars | Large, thick enamel |
| Tibia | Clearly adapted for bipedalism |
| Skull | Primitive, projecting face |

### Significance
- Oldest definitive *Australopithecus*
- Shows transition from *Ardipithecus*
- Tibia demonstrates committed bipedalism
- 2019: MRD cranium from Ethiopia shows face morphology

### Relationship to Later Species
Likely ancestor of *A. afarensis*; fossil evidence from Woranso-Mille (Ethiopia) shows possible anagenetic transition.

## Australopithecus afarensis (3.9-2.9 Ma)

The best-known australopith, represented by hundreds of specimens.

### Discovery
- First discovery: 1973-1974, Hadar, Ethiopia
- Described by: Donald Johanson and Tim White
- Famous specimen: "Lucy" (AL 288-1), discovered November 24, 1974

### Key Specimens

| Specimen | Description | Significance |
|----------|-------------|--------------|
| Lucy (AL 288-1) | 40% complete skeleton | Female, ~1.1 m tall |
| AL 333 ("First Family") | 13+ individuals | Group death, population sample |
| "Selam" (DIK-1-1) | Juvenile female | Child development |
| Laetoli footprints | Preserved trackways | Proof of upright walking |

### Anatomy

**Cranial:**
| Feature | Measurement |
|---------|-------------|
| Brain size | 380-500 cc |
| Face | Prognathic (projecting) |
| Brow ridge | Moderate |
| Sagittal crest | Absent or weak |

**Postcranial:**
| Feature | Condition |
|---------|-----------|
| Pelvis | Short, broad (bipedal) |
| Legs | Relatively short |
| Arms | Relatively long |
| Hands | Curved fingers |
| Feet | Arched, adducted big toe |

### Bipedalism
The Laetoli footprints (3.66 Ma) definitively prove *A. afarensis* walked upright:
- Two individuals walking together
- Arch present in foot
- Big toe aligned with other toes
- Human-like stride

### Sexual Dimorphism
*A. afarensis* showed marked size differences between sexes:
- Males: ~1.5 m, 45 kg
- Females: ~1.0-1.1 m, 29 kg
- Ratio similar to gorillas
- Suggests polygynous mating system

### Diet
Isotopic and dental evidence suggests:
- C3 plant foods (fruits, leaves from trees/bushes)
- Some C4 foods (grasses, sedges, or animals eating them)
- Hard object feeding capability (thick enamel)
- Generalized omnivore

### Paleoecology
Lived in varied environments:
- Woodland and bush habitats
- Gallery forests along rivers
- Grassland margins
- Not primarily a savanna dweller

## Australopithecus africanus (3.3-2.1 Ma)

The first australopith discovered, foundational to understanding human evolution.

### Discovery
- First discovery: 1924, Taung, South Africa
- Described by: Raymond Dart
- Type specimen: "Taung Child" - juvenile skull

### Key Specimens

| Specimen | Site | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| Taung Child | Taung | Juvenile, ~3-4 years old |
| Mrs. Ples (STS 5) | Sterkfontein | Complete adult cranium |
| Little Foot (StW 573) | Sterkfontein | Nearly complete skeleton |

### Anatomy

| Feature | Condition | Compared to *A. afarensis* |
|---------|-----------|---------------------------|
| Brain size | 420-500 cc | Similar |
| Face | Less prognathic | More derived |
| Teeth | Large molars | Similar |
| Body | Similar proportions | Slightly more *Homo*-like? |

### "Little Foot" (StW 573)
Discovered 1994-1997, excavated over 20 years:
- 90% complete skeleton
- ~3.67 Ma (older than many *afarensis*)
- Shows mixture of features
- May require taxonomic revision

### Significance
- Proved Africa was the homeland of humanity
- Initially rejected by scientific community (Piltdown fraud influence)
- Vindicated by subsequent discoveries
- South African cave sites provide unique preservation

## Australopithecus garhi (2.5 Ma)

### Discovery
- Found: 1996
- Location: Bouri, Middle Awash, Ethiopia
- Described by: Berhane Asfaw and colleagues

### Anatomy
| Feature | Condition |
|---------|-----------|
| Cranium | Primitive, *afarensis*-like |
| Teeth | Very large molars |
| Limbs | Long femur (if associated) |

### Tool Association
Found near:
- Stone tools
- Animal bones with cut marks
- Evidence of marrow extraction

### Significance
- Possible maker of earliest Oldowan tools?
- Shows tool use may predate *Homo*
- Transitional morphology

---

## Australopithecus sediba (2.0-1.9 Ma)

A late australopith with *Homo*-like features.

### Discovery
- Found: 2008
- Location: Malapa, South Africa
- Discovered by: Lee Berger's son, Matthew

### Key Specimens
- MH1 (juvenile male)
- MH2 (adult female)
- Exceptionally well-preserved

### Anatomy

| Feature | Condition |
|---------|-----------|
| Brain size | ~420-450 cc |
| Face | Small, *Homo*-like |
| Teeth | Small for australopith |
| Pelvis | Mosaic of features |
| Hand | Precision grip capable |
| Foot | Primitive, ape-like heel |

### Significance
Proposed as:
- Direct ancestor of *Homo*
- Alternative lineage
- Shows mosaic evolution

Controversial due to:
- Late date (after *Homo* appears elsewhere)
- Geographic location
- Mix of primitive and derived features

## Other Species

### Australopithecus bahrelghazali (3.5-3.0 Ma)
- Location: Chad (only Central African australopith)
- Known from: Jaw fragment
- Significance: Extends known range 2,500 km west

### Australopithecus deyiremeda (3.5-3.3 Ma)
- Location: Woranso-Mille, Ethiopia
- Described: 2015
- Significance: Contemporary with *A. afarensis*; suggests multiple lineages

---

## Paranthropus (Robust Australopiths)

Some researchers place robust forms in *Australopithecus*; see [[Paranthropus]] for:
- *P. aethiopicus* (2.7-2.3 Ma)
- *P. boisei* (2.3-1.2 Ma)
- *P. robustus* (2.0-1.5 Ma)

---

## Lifestyle and Behavior

### Diet

Evidence from multiple sources:

| Method | Finding |
|--------|---------|
| Dental morphology | Thick enamel, large molars - hard foods |
| Microwear | Variable, suggests diverse diet |
| Stable isotopes | Mixed C3/C4 signal |
| Associated fauna | Woodland to savanna resources |

### Social Structure
Inferred from:
- Sexual dimorphism → likely polygynous
- Group sites (AL 333) → social living
- No evidence of pair bonding

### Tool Use
- No confirmed tools with *A. afarensis*
- *A. garhi* associated with butchered bones
- Lomekwi 3 tools (3.3 Ma) - maker unknown
- May have used unmodified tools (wood, bone)

### Predators
Australopiths were prey for:
- Large cats (*Dinofelis*, leopards)
- Hyenas
- Crocodiles
- Eagles (Taung Child evidence)

### Key Transitions

| From | To | Changes |
|------|----|---------|
| *Ardipithecus* | *A. anamensis* | Full bipedalism, dental changes |
| *A. anamensis* | *A. afarensis* | Smaller canines, larger brain |
| *A. afarensis* | *A. africanus* | Facial reduction, geographic shift |
| *Australopithecus* | *Homo* | Brain expansion, tool use |
| *Australopithecus* | *Paranthropus* | Megadontia, robust skull |

### Why Did They Go Extinct?
- Climate change (increased variability)
- Competition with *Homo* and *Paranthropus*
- Niche replacement
- Last gracile australopiths: ~2 Ma
- *Paranthropus* persisted until ~1.2 Ma
