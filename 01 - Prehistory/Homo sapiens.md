# Homo sapiens

The species that can delay gratification. Emerging in Africa around 300,000 years ago, Homo sapiens developed cognitive capacities—symbolic thought, language, extended cooperation—that made possible all subsequent economic development. Understanding our species means understanding the biological foundation for investment, trade, and institutional complexity.

## Overview

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Emergence | ~300,000 years ago, Africa |
| Anatomical modernity | Modern body form by ~200,000 BP |
| Behavioral modernity | Symbolic behavior by ~100,000 BP |
| Global spread | Out of Africa ~70,000-50,000 BP |
| Current population | 8+ billion |

## What Makes Homo sapiens Different?

### Cognitive Capacities

| Capacity | Economic Relevance |
|----------|-------------------|
| Language | Coordination, teaching, contracts |
| Symbolic thought | Money, property, institutions |
| Theory of mind | Trade, trust, deception detection |
| Future planning | Investment, storage, agriculture |
| Extended cooperation | Trade networks, division of labor |

### Behavioral Markers

| Behavior | First Appearance |
|----------|------------------|
| Symbolic artifacts | ~100,000 BP (beads, ochre) |
| Long-distance trade | ~100,000 BP (obsidian networks) |
| Art | ~40,000 BP (cave paintings) |
| Complex tools | ~50,000 BP (composite weapons) |
| Burial with goods | ~100,000 BP (investment in afterlife) |

## Economic Implications

### Why These Traits Matter

| Trait | Economic Function |
|-------|------------------|
| Delayed gratification | Investment possible |
| Reputation tracking | Repeated trade games |
| Teaching and learning | Human capital transmission |
| Symbolic communication | Complex coordination |
| In-group/out-group | Trust networks, trade expansion |

### Comparative Advantage

| Comparison | Homo sapiens Advantage |
|------------|----------------------|
| vs. Neanderthals | Larger networks, innovation |
| vs. other primates | Language, extended cooperation |
| vs. earlier hominins | Symbolic thought, planning |

## The Out of Africa Expansion

| Phase | Date | Achievement |
|-------|------|-------------|
| Africa | 300,000-70,000 BP | Species origin, behavioral development |
| Middle East | ~100,000 BP | First expansion (failed?) |
| Global spread | 70,000-15,000 BP | All continents reached |
| Australia | ~50,000 BP | First sea crossing |
| Americas | ~15,000 BP | Last continent |

## Economic Behaviors in Deep Time

### Evidence for Economic Thinking

| Period | Evidence |
|--------|----------|
| 100,000+ BP | Ochre trade networks (100+ km) |
| 70,000 BP | Shell beads (status, exchange) |
| 40,000 BP | Obsidian trade networks (Paleolithic) |
| 20,000 BP | Specialized tools (division of labor) |

### What We Don't See

| Absent Until | Innovation |
|--------------|------------|
| ~10,000 BP | Agriculture, accumulation |
| ~5,000 BP | States, writing |
| ~500 BP | Sustained growth |

This gap—cognitively modern for 200,000 years, economically transformed only recently—is the central puzzle.

## The Cognitive Revolution Debate

### When Did "Modern" Behavior Emerge?

| View | Timing |
|------|--------|
| Gradual | Slow accumulation over 300,000 years |
| Sudden | Cognitive revolution ~50,000 BP |
| Multi-phase | Several transitions |

### What Triggered It?

| Theory | Mechanism |
|--------|-----------|
| Genetic change | Brain mutation enabled language |
| Population density | More people → more innovation |
| Climate pressure | Forced adaptation |
| Cultural accumulation | Threshold effects |

## The Deeper Point

Homo sapiens is the species that can think beyond the present moment. This capacity—to imagine futures, remember pasts, represent absent things, and coordinate with strangers—is the cognitive foundation for all [[Institutions and Progress|economic development]].

But cognitive capacity alone doesn't explain economic progress. Humans had modern brains for 200,000 years before agriculture, 300,000 years before industry. The hardware was present long before the software—the institutions, technologies, and accumulated knowledge—that enabled sustained growth.

The question shifts from "what can humans do?" to "what conditions enable them to do it?" Homo sapiens can invest, trade, specialize, and cooperate at scale. But whether these capacities get channeled into production or extraction depends on [[Institutions and Progress|institutions]] that came much later.

Our species provides the raw material. History determines what gets built with it.
