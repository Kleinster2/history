# Miocene Apes

The Miocene epoch (23-5.3 Ma) witnessed an extraordinary radiation of apes across Africa and Eurasia. Over 40 genera evolved during this period, making it the true "Planet of the Apes." Understanding these diverse species is essential for contextualizing human origins, as our lineage diverged from other apes during the late Miocene.

## Overview

### Taxonomic Context
Miocene apes belong to the superfamily Hominoidea, which today includes:
- **Hylobatidae**: Gibbons and siamangs (lesser apes)
- **Hominidae**: Great apes and humans

During the Miocene, hominoid diversity far exceeded the modern remnant. Most lineages went extinct, with survivors giving rise to the ~20 species of modern apes.

### The Miocene Ape Radiation

| Time Period | Primary Locations | Major Genera |
|-------------|-------------------|--------------|
| Early (23-16 Ma) | East Africa | *Proconsul*, *Afropithecus*, *Morotopithecus* |
| Middle (16-11 Ma) | Africa + Eurasia | *Kenyapithecus*, *Nacholapithecus*, *Dryopithecus* |
| Late (11-5 Ma) | Eurasia + Africa | *Sivapithecus*, *Gigantopithecus*, *Oreopithecus* |

## Early Miocene African Apes (23-16 Ma)

### Proconsul (23-14 Ma)

The best-known early Miocene ape, critical for understanding the ancestral condition.

**Key Species:**
- *Proconsul heseloni* (smallest, ~10 kg)
- *Proconsul nyanzae* (~30 kg)
- *Proconsul major* (largest, ~50 kg)

**Anatomy:**
| Feature | Condition |
|---------|-----------|
| Body size | 10-50 kg (species variable) |
| Tail | Absent (first tailless catarrhine) |
| Locomotion | Generalized arboreal quadruped |
| Brain | Small relative to body (ape-like ratio not yet achieved) |
| Teeth | Thin enamel, fruit-eating adaptation |
| Limbs | Monkey-like proportions |

**Significance:**
- Demonstrates the ancestral ape condition before specialized suspensory adaptations
- Shows that taillessness preceded other ape characteristics
- Important for understanding which features are primitive vs. derived in apes

**Sites:** Rusinga Island, Songhor (Kenya)

### Afropithecus (17-16 Ma)

**Key Features:**
- Large body size (~40-50 kg)
- Robust face with projecting snout
- Thick enamel (hard-object feeding)
- Found in Kenya (Kalodirr, Moruorot)

**Significance:** One of the first apes with thick enamel, suggesting dietary shift toward harder foods.

### Morotopithecus (20-21 Ma)

**Key Features:**
- Large body (~35-50 kg)
- Lower back shows orthograde (upright-trunk) adaptations
- Earliest evidence of the ape body plan

**Significance:** Suggests that orthograde posture (shared by all living apes) evolved very early, possibly before apes left Africa.

### Equatorius (15 Ma)

- Medium-sized ape from Kenya
- Thick enamel
- Transitional between earlier African and later Eurasian apes

## The African-Eurasian Dispersal (17-14 Ma)

### The Migration
Around 17-16 Ma, apes dispersed from Africa into Eurasia, exploiting the newly-formed land connection:

**Enabling Factors:**
- Africa-Eurasia collision closed Tethys Sea
- Miocene Climatic Optimum created continuous forests
- Tropical-subtropical belt extended to mid-latitudes

**Migration Routes:**
- Primary: Through Arabia (Afro-Arabian plate connection)
- Secondary: Possible Mediterranean crossings

**Consequences:**
- Rapid diversification in European and Asian forests
- Geographic isolation led to regional differentiation
- Foundation for orangutan and (possibly) African ape lineages

## Middle Miocene Eurasian Apes (16-11 Ma)

### Dryopithecus (12-9 Ma)

The classic European ape genus.

**Species:**
- *Dryopithecus fontani* (type species, France)
- *Dryopithecus brancoi* (Germany, Hungary)
- *Dryopithecus crusafonti* (Spain)

**Anatomy:**
| Feature | Condition |
|---------|-----------|
| Body size | 20-35 kg |
| Locomotion | Suspensory, orthograde |
| Face | Gracile, projecting snout |
| Enamel | Thin |
| Diet | Soft fruits |

**Significance:**
- Shows clear suspensory adaptations (long arms, curved fingers)
- May be near the ancestry of African apes and humans
- "Dryopithecin" pattern of molar cusps is primitive for apes

### Hispanopithecus (11-9 Ma)

**Key Features:**
- Spanish ape, closely related to *Dryopithecus*
- Highly suspensory (arm-swinging)
- Long, curved hand bones
- Went extinct during late Miocene cooling

### Rudapithecus (10 Ma)

**Key Features:**
- Hungarian species
- Extremely well-preserved skull
- Face similar to African apes
- Possible ancestor of African ape + human clade

**Significance:** One of the most complete Miocene ape skulls; provides critical evidence for ape phylogeny.

### Pierolapithecus (12.5-13 Ma)

**Key Features:**
- Spanish ape with orthograde body plan
- Broad, flat ribcage
- Low, wide hips
- But primitive hand (not highly suspensory)

**Significance:** Shows that the orthograde trunk evolved before specialized suspensory locomotion.

### Anoiapithecus (11.9 Ma)

- Spanish genus
- Combination of primitive and derived features
- Contributes to understanding of great ape origins

## Asian Miocene Apes

### Sivapithecus (12-8 Ma)

The key Asian ape, linked to orangutan ancestry.

**Location:** Siwalik Hills (Pakistan, India)

**Anatomy:**
| Feature | Condition | Significance |
|---------|-----------|--------------|
| Face | Concave profile, narrow orbits | Similar to orangutans |
| Enamel | Thick | Hard-object feeding |
| Body | Medium-large (40-75 kg) | Variable |
| Postcranium | More monkey-like than expected | Convergence in facial features? |

**Species:**
- *Sivapithecus indicus*
- *Sivapithecus sivalensis*
- *Sivapithecus parvada*

**Significance:**
- Clear similarities to orangutans in facial structure
- But body not as specialized for suspension
- Shows mosaic evolution (face and body evolved at different rates)

### Gigantopithecus (9-0.3 Ma)

The largest primate that ever lived.

**Species:**
- *Gigantopithecus giganteus* (India, Miocene-Pliocene)
- *Gigantopithecus blacki* (China, Pleistocene) - largest species

**Size Estimates:**
- Height: 3 meters (10 feet)
- Weight: 200-300 kg
- Molar size: 2.5 cm across

**Diet:** Specialized bamboo/fiber feeder (like a giant panda-ape)

**Extinction:** Survived until ~300,000 years ago, overlapping with *Homo erectus*

### Khoratpithecus (12-7 Ma)

**Location:** Thailand

**Significance:**
- Asian ape possibly related to orangutan ancestry
- Shows ape diversity extended through Southeast Asia

### Lufengpithecus (9-6 Ma)

**Location:** Yunnan, China

**Key Features:**
- Multiple species
- Thick enamel
- Possibly related to orangutan lineage

## Late Miocene African Apes

### Samburupithecus (9.5 Ma)

**Location:** Kenya

**Significance:**
- One of few late Miocene African apes
- Thick enamel
- May document the African ape lineage during the "Eurasian gap"

### Nakalipithecus (10 Ma)

**Location:** Kenya

**Key Features:**
- Large ape
- Thick enamel, robust jaws
- May be near the common ancestor of African apes and humans

**Significance:** Fills the gap in the African fossil record, suggesting apes were present but rare.

### Chororapithecus (10-11 Ma)

**Location:** Ethiopia

**Key Features:**
- Gorilla-sized molars
- Dental similarities to gorillas
- Controversial interpretation

**Significance:** If correctly interpreted, pushes back the gorilla-human split and suggests gorillas evolved in Africa (not via back-migration from Eurasia).

## Mediterranean and Island Apes

### Oreopithecus (8-7 Ma)

A bizarre island ape from Tuscany.

**Environment:** Isolated on the Tusco-Sardinian island

**Key Features:**
| Feature | Condition |
|---------|-----------|
| Body | ~30-35 kg |
| Locomotion | Bipedal when on ground |
| Arms | Long, suspensory adapted |
| Pelvis | Short, broad (bipedal features) |
| Diet | Leaf-eating |

**Significance:**
- Shows convergent evolution toward bipedalism
- Island isolation led to unique adaptations
- Demonstrates that bipedalism can evolve independently

### Ouranopithecus (9-10 Ma)

**Location:** Greece

**Key Features:**
- Large, robust ape
- Very thick enamel
- Massive jaw
- Lived in open, seasonal environments

**Significance:** Shows ape adaptation to non-forest habitats before hominins.

## Relationships to Living Apes

### Modern Great Apes - Miocene Connections

| Living Ape | Likely Miocene Relatives | Split from Human Line (Ma) |
|------------|-------------------------|---------------------------|
| Orangutan | *Sivapithecus*, *Khoratpithecus* | ~15-12 |
| Gorilla | *Chororapithecus*? | ~10-8 |
| Chimpanzee/Bonobo | Unknown | ~7-6 |
| Humans | See [[Early Hominins]] | ~7-6 |

### The "Out of Eurasia" Hypothesis

Some researchers propose:
1. Apes evolved in Africa, migrated to Eurasia (~17 Ma)
2. The African ape + human clade evolved in Europe (*Dryopithecus*, *Rudapithecus*)
3. Ancestors of African apes and humans migrated back to Africa (~10-9 Ma)
4. Final divergences occurred in Africa

**Evidence For:**
- Rich European ape record with human-like features
- Poor African late Miocene record
- *Rudapithecus* facial similarities to African apes

**Evidence Against:**
- New African discoveries filling gaps (*Nakalipithecus*, *Chororapithecus*)
- Molecular clocks suggest African diversification
- Some European features may be convergent

## The Extinction of Miocene Apes

By the end of the Miocene, most ape lineages had gone extinct:

### Causes
1. **Climate change**: Cooling and drying eliminated forest habitats
2. **Forest fragmentation**: Isolated populations, reduced gene flow
3. **Grassland expansion**: C4 grasses replaced ape habitats
4. **Competition**: Monkeys (cercopithecoids) may have outcompeted apes in declining forests

### Survivors
- **Gibbon lineage**: Adapted to Southeast Asian forests
- **Orangutan lineage**: Restricted to Indonesian islands
- **African ape lineage**: Persisted in equatorial refugia
- **Hominin lineage**: Adapted to open habitats

## Key Anatomical Transitions

### From Monkey-Like Ancestor to Ape

| Feature | Ancestral (Monkey-like) | Derived (Ape) | First Appearance |
|---------|------------------------|---------------|------------------|
| Tail | Present | Absent | *Proconsul* (~20 Ma) |
| Trunk | Pronograde (horizontal) | Orthograde (upright) | *Morotopithecus* (~21 Ma) |
| Ribcage | Deep, narrow | Broad, flat | *Pierolapithecus* (~13 Ma) |
| Arms | Short, forelimb-dominated | Long, suspensory | *Dryopithecus* (~12 Ma) |
| Wrist | Limited mobility | Highly mobile | Various times |
| Brain | Smaller | Larger (relative) | Gradual through Miocene |
