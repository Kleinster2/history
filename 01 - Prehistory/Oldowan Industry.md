# Oldowan Industry

The Oldowan is the oldest recognized stone tool industry, dating from approximately 2.6 to 1.7 million years ago. Named after Olduvai Gorge in Tanzania, these simple but effective tools represent the dawn of human technology and mark a fundamental threshold in hominin evolution.

## Overview

### Definition

| Attribute | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Name origin | Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania |
| Time range | 2.6-1.7 Ma (persists later in some areas) |
| Type site | Olduvai Gorge Bed I |
| Key researcher | Mary Leakey |
| Makers | *Homo habilis*, early *H. erectus*, possibly australopiths |

### Core Characteristics

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Technology | Simple percussion flaking |
| Core types | Choppers, polyhedrons, discoids |
| Flake tools | Unretouched or minimally modified |
| Reduction | Limited, opportunistic |
| Symmetry | Absent |
| Planning depth | Minimal |

## Earliest Evidence

### Lomekwi 3, Kenya (3.3 Ma)

The oldest claimed stone tools:
- Discovered: 2011
- Location: West Turkana, Kenya
- Age: 3.3 Ma
- Named: Lomekwian industry

| Feature | Lomekwian | Oldowan |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| Age | 3.3 Ma | 2.6 Ma |
| Core size | Large (up to 15 kg) | Smaller |
| Technique | Passive hammer, bipolar | Active percussion |
| Maker | Unknown (*Kenyanthropus*?) | Early *Homo* |

**Controversy:** Some researchers accept Lomekwi as pre-Oldowan; others question the human origin.

### Gona, Ethiopia (2.6 Ma)

The oldest confirmed Oldowan:
- Location: Gona, Afar, Ethiopia
- Age: 2.6-2.5 Ma
- Artifacts: Cores, flakes, retouched pieces
- Already shows skill and selectivity

### Lokalalei, Kenya (2.34 Ma)

Evidence of refitting:
- Flakes can be fitted back to cores
- Shows reduction sequences
- Demonstrates planning and skill

## Technology

### Manufacture Process

**1. Raw Material Selection:**
- Cobbles from river beds
- Preferably fine-grained stone
- Quartz, basalt, chert used
- Selection for flaking quality

**2. Core Reduction:**
- Strike cobble with hammerstone
- Produce sharp flakes
- Core becomes "chopper" if one side flaked
- Or discoid/polyhedron if multi-directional

**3. Flake Production:**
- Flakes are primary products
- Sharp edges for cutting
- No secondary modification usually

### Tool Types

**Cores:**
| Type | Description | Function |
|------|-------------|----------|
| Chopper | One surface flaked | Pounding, breaking |
| Discoid | Radial flaking | Flake source |
| Polyhedron | Multiple flake scars | Heavy-duty processing |

**Flakes:**
| Type | Description | Function |
|------|-------------|----------|
| Whole flakes | Complete, unmodified | Cutting, slicing |
| Flake fragments | Broken pieces | Various cutting |
| Retouched flakes | Edge modified | Scraping, cutting |

### Raw Materials

| Material | Properties | Preference |
|----------|------------|------------|
| Basalt | Hard, durable | Common |
| Quartz | Hard, sharp | Common |
| Chert/flint | Fine-grained, sharp | Preferred when available |

## Who Made Oldowan Tools?

### Possible Makers

| Species | Evidence |
|---------|----------|
| *Homo habilis* | Found at same sites; named "handy man" |
| *Homo rudolfensis* | Contemporary; capable |
| *Homo erectus* (early) | Made Oldowan before Acheulean |
| *Paranthropus* | Found at sites; may have used but not made |
| *Australopithecus garhi* | Associated with cut-marked bones |

### Cognitive Requirements

Oldowan manufacture requires:
- Understanding fracture mechanics
- Selection of appropriate raw materials
- Planning the reduction sequence
- Hand-eye coordination
- Teaching/learning traditions

### Comparison to Ape Tool Use

| Feature | Chimp Tools | Oldowan |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| Material modification | Minimal | Extensive |
| Stone percussion | Nut cracking | Planned flaking |
| Cumulative culture | Limited | Present |
| Teaching | Limited | Likely |

## Significance

### Evolutionary Importance

The Oldowan represents:

1. **First technology**: Intentional modification of materials
2. **Dietary expansion**: Access to meat, marrow, and new plant foods
3. **Cognitive advancement**: Planning, understanding material properties
4. **Cultural transmission**: Learned behavior passed between generations
5. **Niche construction**: Changing human relationship with environment

### Dietary Implications

| Resource | Tool Function | Benefit |
|----------|--------------|---------|
| Meat | Cutting | High-quality protein |
| Marrow | Percussion | High-fat resource |
| Tubers | Processing | Year-round calories |
| Plants | Cutting, pounding | Broader diet |

### Social Implications

Oldowan toolmaking suggests:
- Teaching and learning
- Raw material transport
- Spatial planning (tool kits)
- Possibly food sharing

## Transition to Acheulean

### Timing
- Acheulean appears: ~1.76 Ma (Kokiselei, Kenya)
- Overlap period: 1.76-1.4 Ma
- Oldowan persists in some areas later

### Key Differences

| Feature | Oldowan | Acheulean |
|---------|---------|-----------|
| Signature tool | Flakes, choppers | Handaxe (biface) |
| Shaping | Minimal | Extensive |
| Symmetry | Absent | Often present |
| Planning | Limited | Greater |
| Reduction | Opportunistic | Standardized |

### Why the Transition?
Possible factors:
- Larger brain size
- Greater cognitive capacity
- New foraging demands
- Cultural innovation

## Experimental Archaeology

### Insights from Replication

| Study | Finding |
|-------|---------|
| Skill requirements | Can be learned quickly |
| Effectiveness | Sharp, functional edges |
| Biomechanics | Requires precision grip |
| Learning curve | Improves with practice |

### Modern Experimental Results
- Flakes cut meat effectively
- Oldowan tools sufficient for butchery
- Chimpanzees can learn basic flaking
- Children learn faster than chimps

## Economic Implications

> The Oldowan represents the birth of economic behavior—the first systematic investment thinking in any species. See [[Origins of Economy]] for the full treatment of why this matters.

### The First Technology Investment

|------------|--------|
| Faster butchery | More time for other activities |
| Access to new foods | Diet diversification |
| Carcass processing | Extract maximum value |
| Tool caching | Reduced search time |

### Division of Labor

| Possibility | Evidence |
|-------------|----------|
| Butchery specialists | Dense cut-marked bones at sites |
| Tool makers | Skill variation in assemblages |
| Transport roles | Heavy stone moved distances |

### Dietary Economics

| Food | Oldowan Contribution |
|------|---------------------|
| Meat | Cut from carcass |
| Bone marrow | Extracted by percussion |
| Tubers | Processed with flakes |
| Nuts/seeds | Pounded with cores |

### Ecological Niche

| Shift | Economic Consequence |
|-------|---------------------|
| Scavenger-hunter | New protein sources |
| Processor of food | Maximized caloric yield |

| Multi-habitat | Range expansion |

### Foundation for Later Economy

| Oldowan Practice | Later Development |
|------------------|-------------------|
| Raw material selection | Mining, quarrying |
| Tool caching | Storage economy |
