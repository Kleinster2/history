# Ice Age

The Ice Ages—specifically the Pleistocene glaciations spanning 2.6 million to 11,700 years ago—profoundly shaped human evolution and dispersal. Repeated cycles of glacial advance and retreat created changing environments to which hominins adapted. Lower sea levels opened land bridges; changing climates drove migration and innovation. The end of the last Ice Age enabled the agricultural revolution that transformed human society.

## Overview
