# Australopithecus afarensis

*Australopithecus afarensis* is one of the best-known early hominins—made famous by "Lucy," a remarkably complete skeleton discovered in Ethiopia in 1974. Living 3.9-2.9 million years ago, *A. afarensis* walked upright but retained tree-climbing adaptations, with a brain size similar to modern apes. This species is a likely ancestor of the genus *Homo*, making it crucial for understanding human evolution's economic origins—the shift to bipedalism that freed hands for tool use.
