# Neanderthals

*Homo neanderthalensis* were our closest evolutionary relatives, inhabiting Europe and western Asia from approximately 400,000 to 40,000 years ago. Far from the brutish cavemen of popular imagination, Neanderthals were sophisticated hunters, skilled toolmakers, and possibly possessed symbolic thought. Their DNA lives on in all non-African humans today.

## Overview

### Definition

| Attribute | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Type specimen | Neanderthal 1 |
| Type locality | Feldhofer Cave, Neander Valley, Germany |
| Named by | William King (1864) |
| Time range | ~400-40 ka |
| Brain size | 1200-1700 cc (larger than modern humans) |
| Distribution | Europe, Western Asia, Central Asia |

### Name Etymology
- "Neander Valley" (Neandertal in German) named after Joachim Neander
- *thal* = valley (old German spelling)
- Modern German: *tal*
- Hence both "Neanderthal" and "Neandertal" are used

## Technology

### Mousterian Industry

The signature Neanderthal technology:

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Core preparation | Levallois technique |
| Tools | Points, scrapers, denticulates |
| Hafting | Stone attached to wooden handles |
| Raw materials | Selective, sometimes transported |

### Levallois Technique

A prepared-core method:
1. Shape core surface (tortoise-shell shape)
2. Prepare striking platform
3. Remove predetermined flake/point
4. Flake shape decided before removal

### Other Technologies

| Technology | Evidence |
|------------|----------|
| Wooden spears | Schöningen (though pre-Neanderthal), Lehringen |
| Birch tar | Campitello, Königsaue |
| String/cordage | Twisted plant fibers (Abri du Maras) |
| Bone tools | Some sites |
| Fire | Widespread evidence |

### Châtelperronian

Late Neanderthal industry with modern human influences:
- Personal ornaments (perforated teeth, shells)
- Bone tools
- Blade technology
- Evidence of acculturation or independent innovation

## Subsistence

### Diet

| Evidence | Finding |
|----------|---------|
| Isotopes | Heavy meat consumption; "top predator" signal |
| Dental calculus | Plant foods, starches, medicinal plants |
| Faunal remains | Hunting large game |
| Microwear | Variable; includes plant processing |
| Coprolites | Meat and plants |

### Hunting

| Prey | Evidence |
|------|----------|
| Mammoth | Cut marks, tool associations |
| Woolly rhinoceros | Butchery sites |
| Wild cattle (aurochs, bison) | Common |
| Horse | Common |
| Red deer | Very common |
| Reindeer | Important in glacial periods |

### Hunting Methods
- Close-range thrusting spears
- Ambush hunting
- Cooperative group hunts
- Possibly scavenging supplemented hunting

### Cannibalism

Evidence at multiple sites:
- Krapina (Croatia)
- El Sidrón (Spain)
- Moula-Guercy (France)
- Les Pradelles (France)

Possible interpretations:
- Nutritional cannibalism (starvation)
- Ritual/funerary practices
- Violence between groups

## Behavior and Cognition

| La Ferrassie | Multiple burials |
| La Chapelle-aux-Saints | Intentional burial |
| Shanidar | "Flower burial" (pollen disputed) |
| Kebara | Intentional grave |
| Roc de Marsal | Possible child burial |

### Symbolic Behavior

Evidence is debated:

| Behavior | Evidence |
|----------|----------|
| Pigment use | Red ochre and manganese dioxide |
| Personal ornaments | Late; possibly influenced by modern humans |
| Cave art | Claimed (Spain), controversial |
| Eagle talons | Collection at multiple sites |
| Feathers | Collection, possible decoration |

### Language

Anatomical evidence:
- Hyoid bone (Kebara): similar to modern humans

- FOXP2 gene: human variant present

Implication: Likely capable of speech, but extent unknown.

## Genetics

### The Neanderthal Genome

| Year | Milestone |
|------|-----------|
| 1997 | First mtDNA sequences |
| 2010 | Draft genome published |
| 2013 | High-coverage genome (Altai) |
| 2014 | High-coverage genome (Vindija) |

### Interbreeding with Modern Humans

| Finding | Details |
|---------|---------|
| Non-African DNA | 1-4% Neanderthal ancestry |
| Introgression events | Multiple encounters |
| Timing | ~60-50 ka in Middle East |
| Direction | Neanderthal → modern humans |
| Reverse flow | Some modern human DNA in late Neanderthals |

### Adaptive Introgression

Neanderthal genes that benefited humans:

| Gene/Function | Benefit |
|---------------|---------|
| Immune genes (HLA) | Pathogen resistance |
| Keratin genes | Skin, hair adaptation |
| Lipid metabolism | Cold adaptation |
| Altitude adaptation | Some Tibetan genes |

### Harmful Introgression

| Association | Effect |
|-------------|--------|
| Depression risk | Higher in some populations |
| Skin lesions | Some associations |
| Blood clotting | Increased risk |
| Smoking addiction | Some associations |

## Extinction

### Timing
- Rapid decline: 45-40 ka
- Last populations: ~40-30 ka
- Coincides with modern human arrival

### Proposed Causes

| Hypothesis | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| Competition | Modern humans outcompeted |
| Climate | Deteriorating conditions |
| Disease | Modern human pathogens |
| Assimilation | Absorbed into modern human populations |
| Violence | Killed by modern humans |
| Low population | Already declining |
| Combination | Multiple factors |

### Why Modern Humans Succeeded?

Possible advantages:
- Larger social networks
- Long-distance trade
- More diverse technology
- Symbolic culture
- Population size
- Dietary flexibility
