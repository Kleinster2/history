# Megafaunal Extinctions

The Late Pleistocene and early Holocene witnessed the disappearance of most of the world's large mammals—mammoths, giant sloths, sabertooth cats, and dozens of other species. This mass extinction coincided with both climate change and human expansion, sparking a long-running debate over its causes.

## Overview

### Definition

| Term | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Megafauna | Animals >44 kg (100 lbs) adult body mass |
| Mega-herbivores | Plant-eating megafauna |
| Mega-carnivores | Predatory megafauna |
| Pleistocene overkill | Human hunting hypothesis |

### Scale of Extinction

| Time Frame | Species Lost | Genera Lost |
|------------|--------------|-------------|
| 50-10 ka | 100+ species | 90+ genera |
| Compare: previous 2 million years | Background rate | Much lower |

## Geographic Pattern

### Extinction by Continent

| Continent | % Megafauna Lost | Timing | Notes |
|-----------|------------------|--------|-------|
| Australia | 88% | ~46 ka | Most severe |
| South America | 83% | 15-10 ka | Very severe |
| North America | 72% | 13-10 ka | Severe |
| Europe | 36% | 50-10 ka | Gradual |
| Africa | 18% | Gradual | Least severe |
| Asia | ~50% | Variable | Regional variation |

### Pattern Observation

- Severity correlates with timing of human arrival
- Africa (long human presence) least affected
- Australia (sudden arrival) most affected
- Americas (late arrival) severe losses

## Africa

## Causes: The Great Debate

### Overkill Hypothesis (Paul Martin)

Humans hunted megafauna to extinction:

| Evidence For | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| Timing correlates | Extinctions follow human arrival |
| Naivety | Animals unfamiliar with humans |
| Hunting evidence | Kill sites, Clovis points |
| Africa comparison | Coevolution protected African fauna |
| Islands pattern | Consistent extinction after arrival |

| Evidence Against | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| Few kill sites | Limited direct evidence |
| Small populations | Could humans kill enough? |
| Continent-wide | Hard to spread extinction |
| Some climate correlation | Climate changed too |

### Climate Hypothesis

Climate change caused extinctions:

| Evidence For | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| LGM/Younger Dryas | Major climate events |
| Habitat loss | Mammoth steppe contracted |
| Previous glacials | Some extinctions earlier |
| Range shifts | Species tracked climate |

| Evidence Against | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| Australia timing | No climate event at 46 ka |
| Previous glacials | Megafauna survived them |
| Africa | Similar climate change, few losses |
| Islands | Extinctions without climate change |

### Synergy Model (Current Consensus)

Combination of factors:

| Factor | Role |
|--------|------|
| Climate change | Stressed populations |
| Human hunting | Reduced numbers |
| Habitat fragmentation | Limited recovery |
| Low reproduction | Slow breeding megafauna |
| Combined effects | Neither alone sufficient |

## Ecological Consequences

### Trophic Cascades

| Effect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Vegetation change | Forest expansion without grazers |
| Fire regimes | Changed with herbivore loss |
| Seed dispersal | Megafauna-dispersed plants affected |
| Nutrient cycling | Reduced with megafauna |

### Missing Megafauna Effects

| System | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| African-style savannas | Would have been more widespread |
| Mammoth steppe | Replaced by tundra/forest |
| American ecosystems | Fundamentally different without megafauna |

### Evolutionary Ghosts

Species evolved for megafauna that no longer exist:
- Osage orange (fruit too large for current fauna)
- Avocado (giant sloth dispersed)
- Honey locust thorns (defense against elephants)
- Joshua trees (sloth dispersed)

## Rewilding Debates

### Pleistocene Rewilding

Proposal to reintroduce megafauna:

| Proposal | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| African elephants | Ecological role of mammoths |
| Lions | Replace American lion |
| Cheetahs | Replace American cheetah |
| Horses | Native to Americas |
| Camels | Native to Americas |

### Controversies

| Concern | Response |
|---------|----------|
| Ecological risk | Unknown consequences |
| Genetic difference | Substitutes not identical |
| Practicality | Logistics, acceptance |
| Ethics | Moving species |
