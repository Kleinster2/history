# Dmanisi

Dmanisi is a remarkable archaeological site in the Republic of Georgia that has produced the oldest hominin fossils found outside Africa—1.8-million-year-old remains of early *Homo erectus*. The exceptional preservation of five skulls and associated postcranial bones has revolutionized our understanding of the first human dispersal from Africa.

## Overview

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Location | Kvemo Kartli region, Georgia |
| Type | Medieval fortress over fossil site |
| Age | 1.85-1.75 Ma |
| Hominins | 5+ individuals (skulls) |
| Species | *Homo erectus* / *Homo georgicus* |
| Significance | Oldest hominins outside Africa |
| Excavation | 1991-present |

## Discovery

### Timeline

| Year | Event |
|------|-------|
| 1983 | Medieval town excavation begins |
| 1984 | Stone tools found in older deposits |
| 1991 | First hominin fossil (mandible D211) |
| 1999 | First skull (D2280) |
| 2001-2005 | Four more skulls found |
| 2013 | Skull 5 (D4500) published |
| Present | Excavations continue |

### The Setting

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Surface | Medieval fortress ruins |
| Underlying | Plio-Pleistocene sediments |
| Deposition | Lake/river edge environment |
| Preservation | Volcanic ash, fine sediments |

## The Hominins

### Five Skulls

| Skull | Age/Sex | Brain (cc) | Notable Features |
|-------|---------|------------|------------------|
| D2280 | Young adult | 650 | Complete female |
| D2282 | Adult | 775 | Large, robust |
| D2700 | Adolescent | 600 | Small, juvenile |
| D3444 | Old adult | 650 | Toothless, survived |
| D4500 | Adult male | 546 | Largest face, smallest brain |

### Skull 5 (D4500)

The most complete early *Homo* skull:

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Discovery | 2005 |
| Publication | 2013 |
| Brain size | 546 cc (smallest *erectus*) |
| Face | Large, projecting |
| Jaw | D2600 (massive mandible) |
| Significance | Shows extreme variation |

### Variation

| Observation | Implication |
|-------------|-------------|
| Brain range | 546-775 cc |
| Facial variation | Extreme differences |
| Body size | Variable |
| Interpretation | One highly variable species |

### Taxonomic Debate

| View | Classification |
|------|----------------|
| Separate species | *Homo georgicus* |
| Regional variant | *H. erectus georgicus* |
| Lumper view | Just *H. erectus* |
| Current trend | Included in *H. erectus* |

## Postcranial Remains

### Skeletal Material

| Element | Findings |
|---------|----------|
| Vertebrae | Several preserved |
| Limb bones | Multiple individuals |
| Feet | Partial |
| Hands | Some bones |

### Body Size

| Estimate | Range |
|----------|-------|
| Height | 1.45-1.66 m |
| Body mass | 40-50 kg |
| Proportions | More primitive than Turkana Boy |
| Build | Small-bodied |

### Implications

| Finding | Significance |
|---------|--------------|
| Small bodies | Left Africa before size increase |
| Small brains | Success without large brains |
| Primitive features | Early in evolution |
| Variable | No single "type" |

## Stone Tools

### Oldowan Industry

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Type | Simple Oldowan (Mode 1) |
| Tools | Choppers, flakes, cores |
| Raw material | Local basalt, quartzite |
| Absence | No Acheulean handaxes |

### Significance

| Issue | Interpretation |
|-------|----------------|
| No handaxes | Left Africa before Acheulean |
| Simple technology | Sufficient for survival |
| Implication | Technology not driver of dispersal |

## Paleoenvironment

### Setting at 1.8 Ma

| Feature | Evidence |
|---------|----------|
| Landscape | Lake margin, grassland |
| Climate | Warm, seasonal |
| Fauna | African + Eurasian mix |
| Vegetation | Open woodland |

### Fauna

| Group | Species Found |
|-------|---------------|
| Carnivores | *Megantereon* (sabertooth), hyenas |
| Herbivores | Horses, deer, rhinos |
| Elephants | Present |
| Ostriches | Eggshell found |

## Significance

### What Dmanisi Proves

| Finding | Significance |
|---------|--------------|
| Early dispersal | 1.8 Ma, very early |
| Small brains | ~600 cc average |
| Small bodies | Not tall, robust |
| Simple tools | Oldowan sufficient |
| Variation | Species-level differences in one population |

### "First Europeans"

| Context | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| Geographic | At Asia-Europe boundary |
| Temporal | Oldest Eurasian hominins |
| Implications | Rapid dispersal after African origins |
| Technology | Basic tool kit successful |

### Implications for *Homo erectus*

| Traditional View | Dmanisi Evidence |
|-----------------|------------------|
| Large-brained | Small-brained individuals |
| Tall | Small-bodied |
| Advanced tools | Simple Oldowan |
| Uniform | Highly variable |

## Care in the Community

### The Toothless Individual (D3444)

| Feature | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| Age | Elderly |
| Condition | Lost all teeth years before death |
| Survival | Bones healed over |
| Implication | Fed by group? |
| Significance | Social care evidence |

## Dating

### Methods

| Method | Results |
|--------|---------|
| Argon-argon | 1.85-1.75 Ma |
| Paleomagnetic | Olduvai Subchron |
| Fauna | Consistent dating |
| Stratigraphy | Well-constrained |

## Current Research

### Ongoing Work

| Focus | Status |
|-------|--------|
| More excavation | Continues annually |
| Analysis | New specimens studied |
| Comparative | DNA attempts (unsuccessful) |
| Conservation | Site protection |

### Open Questions

| Question | Status |
|----------|--------|
| More individuals? | Likely |
| Why this location? | Resource availability |
| How many dispersals? | Debated |
| Single population? | Appears so |
