# Agricultural Revolution

The Agricultural Revolution—humanity's shift from hunting and gathering to farming—was the most consequential transformation in human history before industrialization. Beginning around 10,000 BCE in the [[Fertile Crescent]], this transition enabled population growth, permanent settlement, social stratification, and eventually civilization. Agriculture created food surpluses that supported specialists, cities, and states.

## Overview

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Period | ~10,000-4,000 BCE |
| Origin | Multiple independent centers |
| Character | Shift to food production |
| Effects | Settlement, population, complexity |
| Significance | Foundation of civilization |

## Origins

### Why Agriculture?

| Theory | Argument |
|--------|----------|
| Climate change | [[Holocene Epoch]] warming |
| Population pressure | Resource stress |
| Sedentism | Settlement preceded farming? |
| Social factors | Feasting, ritual |
| Combination | Multiple factors |

### Independent Centers

| Region | Date | Crops |
|--------|------|-------|
| [[Fertile Crescent]] | ~10,000 BCE | Wheat, barley, legumes |
| China | ~9,000 BCE | Rice, millet |
| Mesoamerica | ~7,000 BCE | Maize, squash, beans |
| Andes | ~5,000 BCE | Potato, quinoa |
| Sub-Saharan Africa | ~5,000 BCE | Sorghum, millet |
| New Guinea | ~7,000 BCE | Taro, bananas |

## Process

### Plant Domestication

| Stage | Character |
|-------|-----------|
| Wild harvesting | Collecting |
| Cultivation | Tending wild plants |
| [[Domestication]] | Genetic change |
| Agriculture | Full dependence |

### Animal Domestication

| Animal | Region | Date |
|--------|--------|------|
| Dog | Multiple | ~15,000 BCE |
| Sheep, goat | Near East | ~10,000 BCE |
| Cattle | Near East | ~8,000 BCE |
| Pig | Near East, China | ~8,000 BCE |
| Horse | Central Asia | ~4,000 BCE |

## Spread

### From Fertile Crescent

| Direction | Route |
|-----------|-------|
| Europe | Via Anatolia, Mediterranean |
| South Asia | Eastward |
| North Africa | Westward |
| Mechanism | Migration and adoption |

### Rate

| Region | Arrival |
|--------|---------|
| Greece | ~7,000 BCE |
| Central Europe | ~5,500 BCE |
| Britain | ~4,000 BCE |
| Scandinavia | ~4,000 BCE |

## Consequences

### Demographic

| Effect | Mechanism |
|--------|-----------|
| Population growth | More calories per area |
| Density | Settlement concentration |
| Growth rate | Faster than foragers |

### Settlement

| Change | Character |
|--------|-----------|
| Sedentism | Permanent villages |
| Architecture | Houses, storage |
| Sites | [[Çatalhöyük]], [[Göbekli Tepe]] |

### Social

| Effect | Character |
|--------|-----------|
| Stratification | Surplus enables inequality |
| Property | Land ownership emerges |
| Labor | Division, specialization |

### Health

| Effect | Character |
|--------|-----------|
| Diet | Narrower, less nutritious |
| Disease | New pathogens from animals |
| Stature | Initially decreased |
| Paradox | Worse health, more people |

## Economic Implications

### Surplus

| Effect | Consequence |
|--------|-------------|
| Stored food | Security, wealth |
| Specialists | Non-food producers |
| Trade | Surplus exchanged |
| Power | Control over surplus |

### Property

| Development | Character |
|-------------|-----------|
| Land | Valuable, owned |
| Inheritance | Wealth transmission |
| Inequality | Accumulation begins |

## Debate

### Progress or Trap?

| View | Argument |
|------|----------|
| Progress | Foundation of civilization |
| Trap | Worse life, no going back |
| "Worst mistake" | Jared Diamond's argument |
| Not a one-way door | Graeber & Wengrow argue agriculture was adopted and abandoned multiple times ([[The Dawn of Everything]]) |

### Societies That Abandoned Agriculture

| Case | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Stonehenge-era Britain (~3300 BCE) | Had experienced cereal agriculture, then returned to wild nuts and berries while keeping herding animals; no obvious climate push factor |
| Great Plains (Cheyenne, Lakota) | Had practiced agriculture, acquired horses from the Spanish, became nomadic again |
| American Southwest | Some groups returned to wild resources before European contact |

Scott's "elective affinity" argument: cereal agriculture is uniquely amenable to authoritarian control—it roots people in place, makes them easy to count and tax. Root vegetables (potatoes, taro) are harder to quantify and appropriate, making them a classic form of stealth farming and tax evasion.
