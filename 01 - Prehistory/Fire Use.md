# Fire Use

The control of fire was one of the most transformative developments in human evolution. Fire provided warmth, protection from predators, light to extend the day, and most importantly, the ability to cook food—unlocking calories that may have fueled the expansion of our ancestors' brains.

## Overview

### Stages of Fire Use

| Stage | Description | Evidence Required |
|-------|-------------|-------------------|
| Opportunistic use | Using natural fires | Difficult to detect |
| Fire maintenance | Keeping fire alive | Hearths |
| Fire making | Creating fire at will | Fire-starting tools |

### Benefits of Fire

| Benefit | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| Cooking | More calories, safer food |
| Warmth | Survival in cold climates |
| Protection | Deters predators |
| Light | Extends active hours |
| Social focus | Gathering point |
| Tool making | Heat treatment of stone |
| Land management | Controlled burning |

## Timeline of Fire Use

| Age | Site | Evidence | Species |
|-----|------|----------|---------|
| 1.5-1.0 Ma | Koobi Fora, Kenya | Burned sediments (disputed) | *H. erectus* |
| 1.0 Ma | Wonderwerk Cave, S. Africa | Burned bone, ash | *H. erectus* |
| 790 ka | Gesher Benot Ya'aqov, Israel | Burned seeds, wood | *H. erectus* |
| 400 ka | Multiple European sites | Clear hearths | *H. heidelbergensis* |
| 300 ka | Widespread | Habitual fire use | Multiple species |
| 200-100 ka | Africa, Europe | Universal among humans | *H. sapiens*, Neanderthals |

## Evidence for Fire Use

### Archaeological Evidence

| Type | Description | Example Sites |
|------|-------------|---------------|
| Hearths | Circular burned areas | Many after 400 ka |
| Ash deposits | Accumulated burning | Wonderwerk, Tabun |
| Burned bone | Cooked food | Multiple sites |
| Burned stone | Heat treatment | Many MSA sites |
| Charred seeds | Cooking plant foods | Gesher Benot Ya'aqov |
| Charcoal | Wood fires | Common after 400 ka |

### Problems with Early Evidence

| Issue | Explanation |
|-------|-------------|
| Natural fires | Wildfires leave similar traces |
| Preservation | Fire evidence rarely survives |
| Context | Difficult to associate with hominins |
| Disputed claims | Many early sites contested |

### Secure Evidence

| Criterion | Why Important |
|-----------|---------------|
| Repeated use | Same location, multiple fires |
| Spatial patterning | Organized hearths |
| Associated artifacts | Tools near fires |
| Lack of natural cause | In caves, not lightning |

## The Cooking Hypothesis

### Richard Wrangham's Theory

| Argument | Evidence |
|----------|----------|
| Cooking needed for large brains | Brain is metabolically expensive |
| Timing | Brain expansion after 2 Ma |
| Gut reduction | Smaller gut, larger brain |
| Tooth reduction | Softer cooked food |
| Raw food inadequate | Modern experiments |

### Effects of Cooking

| Effect | Mechanism |
|--------|-----------|
| More calories | Breaks down cell walls |
| Easier digestion | Pre-processed food |
| Safer food | Kills pathogens, parasites |
| Detoxification | Neutralizes plant toxins |
| Protein access | Collagen broken down |
| Time savings | Less chewing needed |

### Anatomical Evidence

| Change | Timing | Implication |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Tooth reduction | After 2 Ma | Softer food |
| Jaw reduction | After 2 Ma | Less chewing |
| Gut reduction | Inferred | Higher quality diet |
| Brain expansion | After 2 Ma | More energy available |

### Criticisms
