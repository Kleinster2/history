# Stone Tool Technology

Humanity's first and longest-lasting technology. For over 3 million years, stone tools were the primary technological extension of human capability. Their evolution—from simple flakes to sophisticated blades—tracks cognitive development and provides the clearest evidence for the emergence of economic thinking: planning, investment, and cumulative innovation.

## Timeline

| Industry | Date | Characteristics |
|----------|------|-----------------|
| Oldowan | 3.3-1.7 Ma | Simple flakes, cores |
| Acheulean | 1.7 Ma-200 ka | Handaxes, symmetry |
| Middle Stone Age/Mousterian | 300-30 ka | Prepared cores, hafting |
| Upper Paleolithic/Later Stone Age | 50 ka-10 ka | Blades, microliths |
| Neolithic | 10 ka+ | Ground stone, polishing |

## Oldowan (~3.3-1.7 million years ago)

### Characteristics

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Maker | Homo habilis, possibly earlier |
| Technique | Simple percussion |
| Products | Flakes, choppers |
| Symmetry | None required |
| Planning | Minimal |

### Economic Implications

| Aspect | Significance |
|--------|--------------|
| Tool use | Extended capability |
| Raw material selection | Basic discrimination |
| Transport | Carry tools or raw material |
| Investment | Minimal time required |

## Acheulean (~1.7 million - 200,000 years ago)

### Characteristics

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Maker | Homo erectus, later species |
| Type tool | Handaxe (biface) |
| Symmetry | Bilateral, deliberate |
| Technique | Soft hammer percussion |
| Duration | 1.5 million years |

### The Handaxe Puzzle

| Question | Significance |
|----------|--------------|
| Why symmetry? | Mental template, aesthetics? |
| Why so stable? | 1.5 million years, little change |
| Multi-purpose? | Or specialized? |
| Sexual selection? | Display of skill? |

### Economic Implications

| Aspect | Significance |
|--------|--------------|
| Planning | Mental template required |
| Skill | Extended learning period |
| Investment | More time per tool |
| Standardization | Consistent form |

## Middle Paleolithic/MSA (~300,000-30,000 years ago)

### Characteristics

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Maker | Neanderthals, early Homo sapiens |
| Key technique | Levallois (prepared core) |
| Innovation | Hafting (attaching to handles) |
| Planning | Multi-step processes |

### Levallois Technique

| Step | Process |
|------|---------|
| 1 | Select nodule |
| 2 | Shape core surface |
| 3 | Prepare striking platform |
| 4 | Remove predetermined flake |
| Result | Consistent, planned shape |

### Economic Implications

| Aspect | Significance |
|--------|--------------|
| Planning depth | Multi-step manufacture |
| Raw material efficiency | Maximum use of stone |
| Composite tools | Hafting = combining materials |
| Specialization | Different tools for different tasks |

## Upper Paleolithic/LSA (~50,000-10,000 years ago)

### Characteristics

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Maker | Modern Homo sapiens |
| Key innovation | Blade technology |
| Diversity | Many specialized types |
| Materials | Bone, antler, ivory added |
| Art | Tools as aesthetic objects |

### Blade Technology

| Advantage | Mechanism |
|-----------|-----------|
| Efficiency | More cutting edge per stone |
| Standardization | Consistent blanks |
| Versatility | Many tools from one core |
| Transportability | Lighter, more efficient |

### Economic Implications

| Aspect | Significance |
|--------|--------------|
| Efficiency | More output per input |
| Specialization | Tools for specific tasks |
| Trade | Standardized products |
| Cultural transmission | Complex teaching required |

## Innovation Patterns

### The Puzzle of Slow Change

| Period | Duration | Major Innovation |
|--------|----------|------------------|
| Oldowan | 1.6 million years | Minimal change |
| Acheulean | 1.5 million years | Stable handaxe |
| Middle Paleolithic | 250,000 years | Gradual improvement |
| Upper Paleolithic | 40,000 years | Rapid diversification |

### Why So Slow?

| Theory | Mechanism |
|--------|-----------|
| Cognitive limits | Early hominins couldn't innovate more |
| Population size | Too few people for innovation |
| Cultural transmission | Couldn't preserve innovations |
| Sufficient | Tools were good enough |

### Why Acceleration?

| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Modern cognition | Better learning, teaching |
| Larger populations | More innovators |
| Better transmission | Ideas preserved, improved |
| Cumulative culture | Innovations build on each other |

## Raw Material Economics

### Selection Criteria

| Factor | Consideration |
|--------|---------------|
| Quality | Fracture predictability |
| Availability | Distance to source |
| Size | Larger = more options |
| Transport cost | Weight, distance |

### Trade Evidence

| Period | Evidence |
|--------|----------|
| Lower Paleolithic | Some transport, not far |
| Middle Paleolithic | 100+ km movement |
| Upper Paleolithic | Extensive exchange networks |

## The Deeper Point

Stone tool technology demonstrates the deep prehistory of [[Institutions and Progress|economic thinking]]. Even the earliest toolmakers were engaging in economic behavior: evaluating raw materials, investing time in manufacture, planning future use. The progression from Oldowan to Upper Paleolithic shows increasing planning depth, specialization, and efficiency—the same trajectory that would later characterize industrial development.

The puzzle of slow early innovation illustrates the role of [[Human Capital|cultural transmission]]. For over a million years, hominins made essentially the same tools. The constraint wasn't raw intelligence but the ability to accumulate improvements across generations. Only when cultural transmission became reliable enough to preserve and build on innovations did technological progress accelerate.

Stone tools also reveal early trade. The movement of quality raw materials over long distances—obsidian, flint—implies either mobility or exchange. By the Upper Paleolithic, regular exchange networks existed, moving materials hundreds of kilometers. These were proto-markets: valued commodities, geographic specialization, and exchange relationships.

The transition from Acheulean stability to Upper Paleolithic diversity parallels later industrial revolutions. In both cases, what changed was not primarily human cognitive capacity but the social and cultural systems that enabled innovation to accumulate. The handaxe-makers had the brains for more sophisticated tools; they lacked the cultural infrastructure to develop them.
