# Göbekli Tepe

Göbekli Tepe is the world's oldest known monumental architecture—a complex of massive stone circles built approximately 11,500 years ago by hunter-gatherers before the invention of pottery, metallurgy, or even agriculture. Its discovery revolutionized our understanding of prehistoric societies, proving that ritual architecture preceded farming.

### Cultural Context

| Period | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| PPNA | Pre-Pottery Neolithic A |
| Subsistence | Hunting-gathering |
| Agriculture | Not yet developed |
| Domestication | Wild species exploited |

## Significance

### Revolutionary Implications

| Old Assumption | Göbekli Tepe Evidence |
|----------------|----------------------|
| Farming → temples | Temples before farming |
| Settled → monumental | Hunter-gatherers built monuments |
| Surplus → religion | Religion before surplus? |
| Cities → organization | Organized before cities |

### "First Came the Temple"

Klaus Schmidt's interpretation:
- Ritual needs drove aggregation
- Social-religious complexity preceded economics
- Sacred sites may have caused sedentism
- Inverts traditional narrative

### What It Tells Us

| Lesson | Evidence |
|--------|----------|
| Hunter-gatherer capability | Built massive structures |
| Social organization | Coordinated labor |
| Symbolic thought | Complex iconography |
| Long-term planning | Generational projects |
| Regional networks | Required cooperation |

## Purpose and Function

| Unknown | May not fit categories |

### Evidence for Ritual

| Feature | Interpretation |
|---------|----------------|
| No domestic structures | Not residential |
| Feasting debris | Large-scale meals |

### Path to Agriculture?

| Development | Economic Connection |
|-------------|---------------------|
| Aggregation | People gathered here |
| Food pressure | Need to feed workers |
| Wild grain use | Evidence of processing |
| Domestication | May have begun nearby |
