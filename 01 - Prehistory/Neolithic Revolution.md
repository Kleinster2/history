# Neolithic Revolution

The Neolithic Revolution represents the transition from hunting and gathering to farming and settled life—one of the most consequential transformations in human history. Beginning around 12,000 years ago, this shift occurred independently in multiple centers worldwide, fundamentally altering human societies, population dynamics, and our relationship with the natural world.

## Why Agriculture?

### Theories for Agricultural Origins

| Theory | Mechanism |
|--------|-----------|
| Population pressure | More people → need more food |
| Climate change | Holocene warming → new opportunities |
| Social competition | Feasting → surplus production |
| Optimal foraging | Declining returns from hunting |
| Sedentism first | Settling → resource intensification |
| Coevolution | Mutual dependence develops |

### The Climate Factor

| Climate Event | Effect |
|---------------|--------|
| Younger Dryas (12.9-11.7 ka) | Cold/dry → stress → intensification |
| Early Holocene warming | Expansion of wild cereals |
| Holocene stability | Favorable for agriculture |

### Why Multiple Centers?

Conditions for independent origins:
- Post-glacial climate change (global)
- Wild ancestors present locally
- Population pressure
- Similar problem-solving

## Process of Domestication

|-------|------|--------------|
| Seed dispersal | Shattering (seeds fall) | Non-shattering |
| Germination | Staggered | Synchronous |

| Growth habit | Bushy | Compact |

### Animal Domestication

| Trait | Wild | Domesticated |
|-------|------|--------------|
| Tameness | Flighty | Docile |
| Breeding | Seasonal | Year-round |
| Size | Variable | Often reduced |
| Horns/tusks | Large | Reduced |
| Coat color | Camouflage | Variable |

### The Domestication Process

| Stage | Description |
|-------|-------------|

## The "Worst Mistake"?

### Jared Diamond's Argument

Agriculture as "worst mistake in human history":
- Decline in nutrition
- Increase in disease
- More work
- Social inequality
- Environmental damage

### Counter-Arguments

| Benefit | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Population support | Couldn't return to foraging |
| Cultural developments | Writing, cities, science |
| Long-term adaptation | Health improved eventually |
| Inevitability | Climate/demographics drove it |
