# Prehistory Index

The earliest chapter of human history, spanning from the deep evolutionary past through the emergence of anatomically modern humans and the development of complex societies before writing.

## Overview

Prehistory encompasses the vast majority of human existence - from the divergence of the human lineage (~7 million years ago) through the invention of writing (~3000 BCE). This period saw the evolution of bipedalism, the expansion of the human brain, the development of tools, and the global spread of our species.

## Deep Time: The Miocene Foundation (23-5.3 Ma)

The Miocene epoch set the stage for human evolution, witnessing the radiation of apes and the emergence of the first hominins.

### Core Notes
- [[Miocene Epoch]] - Overview of the geological period
- [[Miocene Climate and Environment]] - Climate shifts that shaped evolution
- [[Miocene Apes]] - The radiation of apes across Africa and Eurasia
- [[Miocene Fossil Sites]] - Key localities for Miocene fossils

### The First Hominins
- [[Early Hominins]] - *Sahelanthropus*, *Orrorin*, *Ardipithecus*

---

## The Pliocene and Australopiths (5.3-2.6 Ma)

The emergence and diversification of bipedal apes culminating in the origin of our genus.

- [[Pliocene Epoch]] - Climatic changes and early hominin habitats
- [[Australopithecus]] - The first major hominin radiation
- [[Paranthropus]] - The "robust" australopiths and their fate

---

## Early Homo and the Pleistocene (2.6 Ma - 300 ka)

The emergence of our genus, tool technology, and the first dispersals from Africa.

### The Pleistocene World
- [[Pleistocene Epoch]] - The Ice Ages and their impact

### Early *Homo*
- [[Early Homo]] - *H. habilis*, *H. erectus*, and relatives

### Stone Tool Technology
- [[Oldowan Industry]] - The first stone tools (2.6-1.7 Ma)
- [[Acheulean Industry]] - Handaxes and bifaces (1.76 Ma-200 ka)

---

## Archaic Humans (700-40 ka)

The diversification of large-brained hominins across the Old World.

- [[Homo heidelbergensis]] - The common ancestor of later humans
- [[Neanderthals]] - Our closest relatives in Europe and western Asia
- [[Denisovans]] - The Asian sister group known from DNA

---

## Modern Humans (300 ka - present)

The emergence and global spread of *Homo sapiens*.

- [[Homo sapiens Origins]] - African origins and early evolution
- [[Out of Africa]] - The colonization of the world

---

## Upper Paleolithic and Beyond (50-10 ka)

The florescence of human culture, art, and the peopling of the last continents.

- [[Upper Paleolithic]] - Technological and cultural revolution
- [[Cave Art]] - The first visual art tradition

---

## The Neolithic Transition (12,000-4,000 BP)

The shift from foraging to farming that transformed human societies.

- [[Neolithic Revolution]] - Origins of agriculture worldwide
- [[Megafaunal Extinctions]] - The loss of the great beasts

---

## Key Themes

### Evolution
