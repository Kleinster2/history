# Acheulean

The Acheulean—named for Saint-Acheul in France—was the dominant stone tool tradition for over 1.5 million years, making it humanity's longest-lasting technology. Characterized by bifacially worked hand axes with symmetrical shapes, Acheulean tools represent a cognitive advance over earlier Oldowan choppers. Associated primarily with [[Homo erectus]], the Acheulean spread across Africa, Europe, and western Asia before being superseded by more sophisticated Middle Stone Age technologies.

## Overview

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Period | ~1.76 million - 130,000 years ago |
| Duration | 1.6+ million years |
| Character | Bifacial hand axes |
| Maker | Primarily H. erectus |
| Distribution | Africa, Europe, western Asia |

## Technology

### Hand Axes

| Feature | Character |
|---------|-----------|
| Shape | Teardrop, oval |
| Working | Bifacial |
| Symmetry | Deliberate |
| Size | Variable, often ~15 cm |

### Manufacturing

| Technique | Development |
|-----------|-------------|
| Hard hammer | Earlier |
| Soft hammer | Later refinement |
| Planning | Mental template |
| Skill | Considerable |

### Other Tools

| Type | Function |
|------|----------|
| Cleavers | Large cutting tools |
| Picks | Pointed implements |
| Flakes | By-product use |

## Significance

## Development

### Early Acheulean

| Feature | Character |
|---------|-----------|
| Dating | 1.76-1 million years ago |
| Form | Crude, thick |
| Distribution | African |

### Middle Acheulean

| Feature | Character |
|---------|-----------|
| Dating | 1-0.5 million years ago |

|------|----------|--------------|
| Olduvai Gorge | Tanzania | Early examples |
| Olorgesailie | Kenya | Massive accumulation |
| Saint-Acheul | France | Type site |
| Boxgrove | England | Butchering site |

## End of Acheulean

### Replacement
