# Stone Tools

Stone tools were humanity's first technology—and its longest-lasting. From the earliest Oldowan choppers (3.3 million years ago) to Neolithic polished axes, stone tools defined human economic capability for over three million years. Learning to make and use stone tools transformed what humans could eat, where they could live, and how they related to the environment. Stone tool technology is the foundation of all subsequent economic development.
