# Miocene Climate and Environment

The Miocene epoch experienced some of the most consequential climate changes in the Cenozoic era. From tropical warmth to the establishment of modern climate patterns, these shifts fundamentally shaped mammalian evolution and set the stage for human origins.

## Overview

The Miocene spans approximately 18 million years of climate history, transitioning from a greenhouse world to conditions approaching modern patterns. This transformation drove the replacement of forests with grasslands across much of the planet and created the environmental pressures that would eventually produce bipedal hominins.

## Miocene Climatic Optimum (17-14 Ma)

### Conditions
The early-to-mid Miocene experienced the warmest temperatures since the Eocene:

| Parameter | Miocene Optimum | Modern Pre-industrial |
|-----------|-----------------|----------------------|
| Global mean temp | ~18-20°C | ~14°C |
| CO2 levels | 400-500 ppm | 280 ppm |
| Arctic temp | 10-15°C warmer | - |
| Sea level | 25-40 m higher | - |

### Evidence
- **Deep-sea cores**: Oxygen isotope ratios show reduced ice volume
- **Fossil plants**: Subtropical flora in mid-latitudes (UK, Alaska, Antarctica margins)
- **Crocodilians**: Found at 60°N latitude
- **Coral reefs**: Extended far beyond modern tropics

### Geographic Distribution of Warmth
- Reduced temperature gradient between equator and poles
- Ice-free Arctic Ocean in summer
- Antarctic ice sheets present but reduced
- Mediterranean region tropical to subtropical

### Ecological Implications
- Extensive tropical and subtropical forests
- High biodiversity in forest ecosystems
- Apes diversified in continuous forest belts
- *Proconsul* and early apes thrived in African forests

## Middle Miocene Climate Transition (14-13 Ma)

### The Cooling Event
A dramatic climate shift occurred around 14-13 Ma, fundamentally altering global ecosystems:

| Change | Magnitude |
|--------|-----------|
| Global cooling | 6-7°C over ~1 million years |
| Antarctic ice | Major expansion |
| Sea level fall | 40-50 meters |
| CO2 decline | 400+ to ~280 ppm |

### Causes
Multiple factors contributed to this transition:

1. **Antarctic Circumpolar Current**: Fully established, thermally isolating Antarctica
2. **Himalayan uplift**: Enhanced chemical weathering, drew down CO2
3. **Ocean circulation changes**: Modified heat transport
4. **Orbital forcing**: Milankovitch cycles triggered ice accumulation

### Consequences
- **Forest fragmentation**: Tropical forests retreated toward equator
- **Ape crisis**: Many Miocene ape lineages went extinct
- **Fauna turnover**: Shift in mammalian communities
- **Grassland emergence**: First significant C4 grassland expansion

## Late Miocene Cooling and Drying (11-5 Ma)

### Global Patterns
The late Miocene saw continued deterioration of warm, wet conditions:

- Progressive global cooling
- Increased aridity on multiple continents
- Intensified monsoon systems
- Greater seasonality

### C4 Grassland Expansion

The expansion of C4 (warm-season) grasses transformed Earth's surface:

| Time (Ma) | C4 Grass Coverage |
|-----------|-------------------|
| 15 | Minimal (<5% of tropics) |
| 10 | Moderate (10-20%) |
| 8 | Significant (30-40%) |
| 6 | Dominant in many regions (>50%) |

**C4 Advantages:**
- Higher water-use efficiency
- Better performance in hot, dry, low-CO2 conditions
- Faster growth in seasonal environments

**Ecological Impact:**
- Grasslands replaced woodlands across Africa, Asia, Americas
- Grazing mammals diversified (bovids, horses, elephants)
- Forest-dwelling species faced habitat loss
- Created mosaic habitats (woodland-grassland transitions)

### Regional Patterns

#### Africa
- East African forests fragmented
- Savanna expansion from 10 Ma onward
- Rift Valley created varied microhabitats
- Critical period for hominin evolution

#### Eurasia
- Mediterranean region dried significantly
- Central Asian steppes expanded
- Monsoon intensification in South Asia
- European forests retreated southward

#### Americas
- Great Plains grasslands developed
- South American savannas expanded
- Andean uplift affected climate patterns

## Messinian Salinity Crisis (5.96-5.33 Ma)

### The Event
One of the most dramatic environmental events in Earth's recent history:

- Mediterranean Sea became isolated from Atlantic
- Evaporation exceeded inflow
- Sea nearly dried up completely
- Massive salt deposits (1-3 km thick in places)

### Causes
- Tectonic movements closed the Strait of Gibraltar
- Global sea level lowered during glacial phases
- Threshold effect triggered rapid desiccation

### Evidence
- Thick evaporite deposits throughout Mediterranean basin
- Erosion canyons cut deep below modern sea level
- Salt layers visible in seismic surveys
- Fossil desert fauna in Mediterranean region

### Consequences

**Physical:**
- Mediterranean floor dropped 3-4 km below sea level
- Salt concentration reached saturation
- Deep canyons carved by rivers (Nile, Rhone)
- Extreme temperatures in the desiccated basin

**Biological:**
- Marine fauna extinction in Mediterranean
- Land bridges connected Africa, Europe, and various islands
- Migration corridors for terrestrial animals
- Habitat stress for many species

**Termination:**
- Zanclean Flood (~5.33 Ma): Atlantic waters breached the barrier
- Mediterranean refilled catastrophically (possibly in centuries)
- One of the largest floods in Earth's history

## Monsoon Development

### Asian Monsoon Intensification
The Tibetan Plateau's rise strengthened the Asian monsoon system:

| Time (Ma) | Monsoon Intensity | Tibetan Elevation |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------------|
| 20 | Weak | ~2000 m |
| 15 | Moderate | ~3000 m |
| 10 | Strong | ~4000 m |
| 8 | Near-modern | ~4500+ m |

### African Monsoon
- East-west climate gradient intensified
- Seasonal rainfall patterns established
- Controlled savanna-forest boundaries
- Influenced hominin habitat distribution

## Oceanographic Changes

### Thermohaline Circulation
- Modern circulation patterns establishing
- Antarctic Bottom Water production increased
- North Atlantic Deep Water formation began
- Enhanced ocean stratification

### Sea Level
| Time (Ma) | Sea Level (relative to today) |
|-----------|------------------------------|
| 20 | +30 m |
| 14 | +20 m |
| 10 | +10 m |
| 6 | -10 to +10 m (oscillating) |

## Implications for Human Evolution

### Environmental Selection Pressures

The Miocene climate changes created conditions favoring hominin characteristics:

| Environmental Change | Evolutionary Pressure | Potential Adaptation |
|---------------------|----------------------|---------------------|
| Forest fragmentation | Terrestrial locomotion | Bipedalism |
| Grassland expansion | Predator visibility | Upright posture |
| Seasonal resources | Dietary flexibility | Tool use, omnivory |
| Variable climate | Behavioral plasticity | Larger brains |
| Open habitats | Long-distance travel | Efficient locomotion |

### Habitat Variability Hypothesis
Richard Potts proposed that high-amplitude climate variability, not just directional change, selected for adaptability in hominins:
- Rapidly fluctuating environments favored generalists
- Behavioral flexibility became advantageous
- Explains broad hominin ecological tolerances

## Proxy Evidence

### Methods for Reconstructing Miocene Climate

| Proxy | Information Provided |
|-------|---------------------|
| Oxygen isotopes (δ18O) | Ice volume, temperature |
| Carbon isotopes (δ13C) | Vegetation type (C3 vs C4) |
| Leaf margin analysis | Paleotemperature |
| Fossil pollen | Vegetation communities |
| Paleosols | Precipitation, temperature |
| Mammal teeth isotopes | Diet, habitat |
