# Oldowan

The Oldowan—named for Olduvai Gorge in Tanzania—was humanity's first recognizable stone tool industry, beginning around 2.6 million years ago. These simple but effective tools, primarily choppers and sharp flakes, represent a cognitive threshold: the ability to envision a tool within a rock and extract it through systematic percussion. Oldowan tools were essential for processing meat and marrow, contributing to dietary changes that fueled brain expansion.
