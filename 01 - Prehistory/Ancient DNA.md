# Ancient DNA

Ancient DNA (aDNA) has revolutionized our understanding of human prehistory. By extracting and sequencing genetic material from bones and teeth, scientists have rewritten migration histories, discovered unknown human species, and revealed population replacements invisible to archaeology alone. Since the 2010s, aDNA has transformed from experimental technique to essential tool, providing direct evidence of ancestry, admixture, and movement.

## Overview

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Definition | DNA from ancient remains |
| Revolution | 2010s onward |
| Impact | Rewrote prehistory |
| Key advance | High-throughput sequencing |

## Technical Development

### History

| Date | Advance |
|------|---------|
| 1984 | First ancient DNA extracted |
| 1990s | PCR amplification |
| 2010 | Neanderthal genome |
| 2010s | Massive population studies |

### Methods

| Technique | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| Petrous bone | Best DNA preservation |
| Sequencing | Full genome possible |
| Contamination control | Critical |
| Bioinformatics | Analysis |

## Major Discoveries

### Human Evolution

| Finding | Significance |
|---------|--------------|
| Neanderthal admixture | 1-4% in non-Africans |
| [[Denisovans]] | New species from DNA |
| Multiple admixtures | Complex history |
| Out of Africa | Timing refined |

### Population History

| Region | Discovery |
|--------|-----------|
| Europe | Massive replacement ~5000 BCE |
| Americas | Multiple migrations |
| Pacific | Settlement routes |
| India | Complex mixing |

## European Prehistory Rewritten

### Three Ancestries

| Population | Origin |
|------------|--------|
| Hunter-gatherers | Paleolithic Europeans |
| Farmers | Anatolia, ~6000 BCE |
| Steppe pastoralists | Yamnaya, ~3000 BCE |

### Migrations

| Event | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| Neolithic | Farmers largely replace HG |
| Bronze Age | Steppe ancestry spreads |
| Indo-Europeans | Language with genes |

## Implications

### For Archaeology

| Change | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Migration debate | Now measurable |
| Culture vs. people | Can distinguish |
| Trade vs. movement | Separable |
| Chronology | Refined |

### For History

| Topic | Impact |
|-------|--------|
| Indo-Europeans | Movement demonstrated |
| Language spread | With or without people |
| Disease | Pathogen DNA |
| Social structure | Family reconstruction |

## Case Studies

### Yamnaya Expansion

| Feature | Finding |
|---------|---------|
| Origin | Pontic steppe |
| Spread | Europe, South Asia |
| Impact | 50%+ ancestry in Europe |
| Association | Indo-European languages |

### Pacific Settlement

| Finding | Significance |
|---------|--------------|
| Origins | Taiwan |
| Route | Island hopping |
| Timing | 3000-1000 BCE |
| Admixture | Papuan contact |

## Controversies

### Issues

| Concern | Debate |
|---------|--------|
| Sampling bias | Rich regions overrepresented |
| Interpretation | Migration vs. admixture |
| Ethics | Indigenous concerns |
| Nationalism | Misuse potential |

### Limitations

| Issue | Problem |
|-------|---------|
| Preservation | Tropical regions poor |
| Africa | Undersampled |
| Ancient periods | Degraded DNA |
| Complexity | Models simplified |

## Economic History Applications

### Agriculture Spread

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| Demic diffusion? | Yes, in Europe |
| Cultural adoption? | Also occurred |
| Replacement? | Substantial |

### Trade vs. Migration

| Goods | People? |
|-------|---------|
| Can distinguish | Through genetics |
| Bronze Age | Both occurred |
| Historical periods | Testable |

## Future Directions

| Development | Potential |
|-------------|-----------|
| Larger samples | Population statistics |
| New regions | Africa, Asia |
| Older samples | 100,000+ years |
| Integration | With archaeology |
