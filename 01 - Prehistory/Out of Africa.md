# Out of Africa

The dispersal of modern humans from Africa represents one of the most consequential events in human history. Between approximately 70,000 and 45,000 years ago, small groups of *Homo sapiens* left their African homeland and ultimately colonized every continent except Antarctica, replacing or absorbing all other human species.

## Overview

### The Migration

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Origin | Africa |
| Timing | Main dispersal ~70-50 ka |
| Routes | Northern (Sinai) and/or Southern (Bab el-Mandeb) |
| Result | Global colonization |
| Other species | Replaced Neanderthals, Denisovans, others |
| Interbreeding | Limited gene flow with archaic humans |

### Key Questions

1. When did modern humans leave Africa?
2. Which routes did they take?
3. How many dispersal events occurred?
4. What enabled successful expansion?

## Early Dispersals (Failed or Limited)

### Skhul and Qafzeh (130-90 ka)

Early modern humans in the Levant:

| Site | Age (ka) | Specimens | Status |
|------|----------|-----------|--------|
| Skhul | 130-90 | ~10 individuals | Modern anatomy |
| Qafzeh | 130-90 | ~15 individuals | Modern anatomy |

**Outcome:**
- Did not lead to permanent colonization
- Population likely retreated or went extinct
- Replaced by Neanderthals by 70 ka
- Climate deterioration (MIS 4) possible cause

### Misliya Cave (194-177 ka)

Possible even earlier exit:
- Partial maxilla with modern features
- If confirmed, shows very early attempts
- Did not lead to lasting occupation

## The Main Dispersal (70-45 ka)

### Timing

| Evidence | Suggested Date |
|----------|----------------|
| Archaeology (Australia) | 65-50 ka |
| Genetics (coalescence) | ~70-60 ka |
| Fossils (Asia) | 80-50 ka |
| Consensus | ~70-50 ka main wave |

### Genetic Evidence

The main dispersal is marked by:
- All non-Africans descend from small founder population
- Genetic diversity decreases with distance from Africa
- Neanderthal DNA introgression dated to ~50-60 ka
- mtDNA and Y-chromosome coalescence times

## Routes

### The Two Possible Routes

**Northern Route (via Sinai):**
| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Path | Nile → Sinai → Levant |
| Terrain | Land route throughout |
| Advantages | Continuous land, familiar environments |
| Challenges | Neanderthal presence |

**Southern Route (via Bab el-Mandeb):**
| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Path | Horn of Africa → Arabia → Asia |
| Crossing | Bab el-Mandeb strait (~30 km at glacial low) |
| Advantages | Coastal resources, fewer competitors |
| Challenges | Sea crossing, later aridity |

### Current Evidence

| Factor | Northern | Southern |
|--------|----------|----------|
| Archaeological evidence | Strong (Levantine sites) | Limited but growing |
| Genetic models | Supported | Supported |
| Fossil evidence | Good | Sparse |
| Current view | Probably both | Possibly main route |
