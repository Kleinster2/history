# Behavioral Modernity

Behavioral modernity refers to the suite of cognitive and cultural capabilities that distinguish *Homo sapiens* from earlier hominins—symbolic thought, art, complex tools, long-distance trade, and organized society. When and how our ancestors became "fully modern" in behavior remains debated: Was it a sudden revolution ~50,000 years ago, or a gradual accumulation over hundreds of thousands of years?

## Overview

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Definition | Full suite of modern human behaviors |
| Timing | Debated: 100 ka gradual vs. 50 ka revolution |
| Location | Africa (earliest evidence) |
| Markers | Art, symbolism, complex tools |

## Markers of Behavioral Modernity

### The Checklist

| Behavior | Earliest Evidence |
|----------|-------------------|
| Abstract/symbolic thought | 100+ ka (ochre) |
| Art | 100+ ka (engravings) |
| Blade technology | 70+ ka |
| Bone tools | 90+ ka |
| Long-distance trade | 130+ ka |
| Personal ornaments | 100+ ka |
| Fishing | 90+ ka |
| Burials | 100+ ka |

## African Evidence

### South African Sites

| Site | Evidence | Age |
|------|----------|-----|
| Blombos Cave | Engraved ochre, beads | 100-75 ka |
| Pinnacle Point | Ochre, shellfish | 160 ka |
| Border Cave | Beads, tools | 75 ka |

### East African Sites

| Site | Evidence | Age |
|------|----------|-----|
| Enkapune Ya Muto | Beads | 40+ ka |
| Mumba | Beads | 50+ ka |

### North African Sites

| Site | Evidence | Age |
|------|----------|-----|
| Grotte des Pigeons | Beads | 80+ ka |
| Aterian sites | Tanged points | 80+ ka |

## The Debate

### Revolution Model (Old View)

| Claim | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Timing | ~50,000 years ago |
| Location | Europe or Near East |
| Mechanism | Genetic mutation ("human revolution") |
| Evidence | Upper Paleolithic explosion |

### Gradualist Model (Current)

| Claim | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Timing | Gradual, starting 100+ ka |
| Location | Africa |
| Mechanism | Cultural accumulation |
| Evidence | African Middle Stone Age |

## Why Africa First?

| Factor | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| Anatomical modernity | First in Africa (~300 ka) |
| Population | Largest, most diverse |
| Time depth | Longest behavioral record |
| Evidence gap | Preservation, research bias |

## Cognitive Requirements

| Capacity | Expression |
|----------|------------|
| Symbolic thought | Art, ornaments |
| Planning depth | Complex tools |
| Social learning | Cultural transmission |
| Language | Coordination, trade |

## Economic Implications

| Behavior | Economic Effect |
|----------|-----------------|
| Long-distance trade | Exchange networks |
| Specialized tools | Efficiency |
| Resource planning | Storage, scheduling |
| Social organization | Division of labor |

## Significance

| Question | Relevance |
|----------|-----------|
| Human uniqueness | What makes us different |
| Economic origins | Foundations of exchange |
| Cultural evolution | Accumulation over time |
| Modern behavior | Not just big brains |
