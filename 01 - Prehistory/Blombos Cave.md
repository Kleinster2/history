# Blombos Cave

The site that rewrote human origins. Located on South Africa's southern coast, Blombos Cave contains evidence of symbolic behavior—engraved ochre, shell beads, bone tools—dating to 100,000 years ago, pushing back the timeline of behavioral modernity and shifting the story from Europe to Africa.

## The Site

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Location | Southern Cape coast, South Africa |
| Excavations | Since 1991 (Christopher Henshilwood) |
| Deposits | 100,000-70,000 BP |
| Significance | Earliest clear symbolic behavior |

## Key Discoveries

### Engraved Ochre

| Find | Date | Significance |
|------|------|--------------|
| Crosshatched patterns | ~100,000 BP | Abstract geometric designs |
| Deliberate marking | Not utilitarian | Symbolic communication |
| Multiple pieces | Pattern is intentional | Not accidental |

### Shell Beads

| Find | Date | Significance |
|------|------|--------------|
| Nassarius shells | ~100,000 BP | Perforated for stringing |
| Ochre staining | Deliberate coloring | Decorative intent |
| Selection | Specific species chosen | Aesthetic preference |

### Bone Tools

| Find | Date | Significance |
|------|------|--------------|
| Bone points | ~77,000 BP | Carefully shaped |
| Awls | Various dates | Sophisticated manufacture |
| Standardization | Consistent forms | Mental templates |

### Ochre Processing

| Evidence | Implication |
|----------|-------------|
| Grinding stones | Pigment preparation |
| Ochre crayons | Drawing, body painting |
| Processing kits | Complex tool use |
| Scale | Significant activity |

## Economic Implications

### What Blombos Reveals

| Evidence | Economic Relevance |
|----------|-------------------|
| Symbolic artifacts | Capacity for abstract representation |
| Standardized tools | Mental templates, teaching |
| Shell beads | Status markers, possibly exchange |
| Planning | Collection, processing, storage |

### Trade Indicators

| Evidence | Implication |
|----------|-------------|
| Non-local materials | Movement, possibly exchange |
| Marine shells inland | Transport, value attribution |
| Ochre sources | Knowledge of landscape |

## Significance for Human Origins

### Before Blombos

| Assumption | View |
|------------|------|
| "Creative explosion" | Europe, ~40,000 BP |
| Modern behavior | Late and sudden |
| Africa | "Merely" anatomical modernity |

### After Blombos

| Revision | New View |
|----------|----------|
| Symbolic thought | At least 100,000 BP |
| Africa | Origin of behavioral modernity |
| Gradual development | Not sudden revolution |
| Continuity | MSA → Later Stone Age |

## The Deeper Point

Blombos demonstrates that the cognitive capacities underlying economic behavior—symbolic thought, planning, abstract representation—are far older than previously believed. The humans who engraved ochre 100,000 years ago had brains capable of creating money, property rights, and contracts. They didn't develop these [[Institutions and Progress|institutions]] for another 90,000+ years.

This gap between capacity and realization is the central mystery. Blombos shows the hardware was ready; the software—the social and institutional arrangements that channel human creativity into sustained progress—took much longer to develop. The beads and engravings were possible because of symbolic cognition. Agriculture, cities, and industry required institutional innovations that had nothing to do with brain evolution.

The site also reveals that economic behavior predates what we usually call "economy." The shell beads may have functioned as status markers or exchange items—proto-money, perhaps. The ochre processing suggests organized activity, possibly specialization. These early South Africans were engaging in recognizably economic behavior: planning, valuing, perhaps trading. What they lacked were the institutions that would later amplify these behaviors into sustained growth.
