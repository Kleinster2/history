# Domestication

Domestication—the genetic and behavioral modification of plants and animals for human use—was the foundation of agriculture and civilization. Over millennia, humans transformed wild species into crops and livestock, creating the food surplus that enabled cities, states, and economic complexity. This was not a single event but multiple independent processes across the globe.

## Overview

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Definition | Genetic modification through selective breeding |
| Period | ~12,000-4,000 BCE (initial wave) |
| Centers | Multiple independent origins |
| Effect | Foundation of civilization |

## Centers of Domestication

### Primary Centers

| Center | Location | Key Domesticates |
|--------|----------|------------------|
| Fertile Crescent | SW Asia | Wheat, barley, sheep, goats |
| China | East Asia | Rice, millet, pigs |
| Mesoamerica | Mexico | Maize, beans, squash |
| Andes | South America | Potato, llama, alpaca |
| Sub-Saharan Africa | Various | Sorghum, millet, cattle |
| New Guinea | Pacific | Taro, bananas |

## Plant Domestication

### Major Crops

| Crop | Origin | Date |
|------|--------|------|
| Wheat | Fertile Crescent | ~10,000 BCE |
| Barley | Fertile Crescent | ~10,000 BCE |
| Rice | China | ~8,000 BCE |
| Maize | Mesoamerica | ~7,000 BCE |
| Potato | Andes | ~8,000 BCE |

### Domestication Syndrome

| Wild Trait | Domesticated Trait |
|------------|-------------------|
| Seed shattering | Seeds stay on plant |
| Dormancy | Rapid germination |
| Small seeds | Larger seeds |
| Thorns/toxins | Reduced defenses |

## Animal Domestication

### Major Livestock

| Animal | Origin | Date | Use |
|--------|--------|------|-----|
| Dog | Eurasia | ~15,000+ BCE | Hunting, guarding |
| Sheep | SW Asia | ~9,000 BCE | Meat, wool |
| Goat | SW Asia | ~9,000 BCE | Meat, milk |
| Cattle | SW Asia | ~8,000 BCE | Meat, milk, draft |
| Pig | SW Asia/China | ~8,000 BCE | Meat |
| Horse | Central Asia | ~4,000 BCE | Transport, war |

### Why These Animals?

| Trait | Requirement |
|-------|-------------|
| Social | Herd animals |
| Hierarchy | Accept human dominance |
| Diet | Not compete with humans |
| Breeding | Reproduce in captivity |
| Growth | Fast maturation |
| Temperament | Not too aggressive |

## Economic Consequences

| Change | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Food surplus | Population growth |
| Sedentism | Permanent settlements |
| Specialization | Division of labor |
| Property | Ownership of animals, land |
| Inequality | Wealth accumulation |

## Geographic Luck

### Jared Diamond's Argument

| Region | Domesticates Available |
|--------|------------------------|
| Eurasia | Many large-seeded grasses, mammals |
| Africa | Fewer suitable species |
| Americas | Fewer mammals (post-extinction) |
| Australia | Almost none |
