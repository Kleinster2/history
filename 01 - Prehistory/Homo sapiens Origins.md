# Homo sapiens Origins

*Homo sapiens* ("wise human") emerged in Africa approximately 300,000 years ago, making us a relatively young species. Our origins involved gradual evolution across the African continent, followed by dispersal out of Africa and the eventual replacement or absorption of all other human species.

## Overview

### Defining Homo sapiens

| Feature | Anatomically Modern Humans |
|---------|---------------------------|
| Skull shape | High, rounded (globular) |
| Face | Flat, retracted under braincase |
| Brow ridge | Reduced or absent |
| Chin | Present (unique among hominins) |
| Forehead | Vertical |
| Brain size | ~1350 cc average |
| Body build | Gracile compared to archaic humans |

### Key Terms

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Anatomically Modern Human (AMH) | *H. sapiens* with modern skeletal features |
| Behaviorally Modern Human | Displaying symbolic thought, complex technology |
| Archaic *H. sapiens* | Transitional/earlier forms with some modern features |

## Chronology of Origins

### Timeline

| Time (ka) | Event |
|-----------|-------|
| ~600-500 | *H. heidelbergensis* ancestral population |
| ~400-300 | Transition to *H. sapiens* morphology |
| 315 | Jebel Irhoud fossils (oldest known *H. sapiens*) |
| 260-200 | Florisbad, Omo Kibish - early *sapiens* |
| 195 | Omo I - fully modern anatomy |
| 120-90 | Modern humans reach Middle East |
| 80-60 | Expansion into Asia |
| 65-50 | Arrival in Australia |
| 45-40 | Arrival in Europe |
| 25-15 | Arrival in Americas |

## Key Fossil Evidence

### Earliest Homo sapiens

| Site | Age (ka) | Location | Features |
|------|----------|----------|----------|
| Jebel Irhoud | 315 | Morocco | Archaic-to-modern transition |
| Florisbad | 260 | South Africa | Partial cranium |
| Omo I | 195 | Ethiopia | Fully modern |
| Omo II | 195 | Ethiopia | More archaic features |
| Herto | 160 | Ethiopia | Modern morphology |

### Jebel Irhoud (Morocco)

Re-dated in 2017, the oldest *H. sapiens*:

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Age | 315 ± 34 ka |
| Specimens | Multiple individuals |
| Face | Modern, flat |
| Braincase | Elongated (archaic feature) |
| Significance | Pushes back *sapiens* origin by 100,000 years |
| Location | Northwest Africa |

**Implications:**
- *H. sapiens* evolution was pan-African
- Not restricted to East Africa
- Gradual acquisition of modern features

### Omo Kibish (Ethiopia)

Classic early *H. sapiens* site:

| Specimen | Features |
|----------|----------|
| Omo I | Fully modern skull |
| Omo II | More archaic features |
| Both | ~195 ka |

### Herto (Ethiopia)

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Age | ~160 ka |
| Specimens | Adult crania, child skull |
| Anatomy | Modern but robust |
| Modification | Cut marks (possible mortuary practice) |
| Named | *Homo sapiens idaltu* (subspecies) |

## Models of Human Origins

### Recent African Origin (Out of Africa)

The dominant model:

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Origin | Africa |
| Timing | ~300 ka |
| Dispersal | Replaced other populations |
| Gene flow | Some interbreeding with archaics |

**Evidence:**
- Oldest *sapiens* fossils in Africa
- Greatest genetic diversity in Africa
- Genetics show African origin
- Fossil evidence of replacement

### Multiregional Evolution

Older alternative model:

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Origin | Multiple regions |
| Evolution | Parallel evolution of modern features |
| Gene flow | Continuous between populations |

**Status:** Largely rejected, but gene flow component validated

### African Multiregionalism

Current nuanced view:

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Origin | Africa |
| Population structure | Multiple interconnected groups |
| Evolution | Mosaic, not single lineage |
| Gene flow | Between African populations |

**Evidence:**
- Modern features appear in different African regions at different times
- Jebel Irhoud (NW Africa), Omo (E Africa), Florisbad (S Africa)
- Complex population dynamics

## Anatomy: The Modern Package

### Cranial Evolution

| Feature | Archaic Condition | Modern Condition |
|---------|-------------------|------------------|
| Vault shape | Long, low | High, rounded |
| Brow ridge | Large | Reduced |
| Face | Projecting | Retracted |
| Chin | Absent | Present |
| Forehead | Receding | Vertical |
| Occipital | Angled | Rounded |

### The Globular Braincase

Modern skulls are distinctly round:
- Parietal and cerebellar expansion
- Bulging forehead
- Rounded occipital
- Develops in first year of life

### Why a Chin?

Unique to *H. sapiens*; proposed explanations:
- Facial reduction with bone support
- Speech-related muscle attachments
- Mechanical stress resistance
- Possibly no adaptive function

### Postcranial Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Body build | Relatively gracile |
| Limb proportions | Long legs (tropical adaptation) |
| Pelvis | Narrower than Neanderthals |
| Strength | Less robust than archaics |

## Behavioral Modernity

### What is "Behavioral Modernity"?

A suite of behaviors considered uniquely modern human:

| Behavior | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| Symbolic thought | Art, decoration, ritual |
| Complex technology | Composite tools, hafting |
| Long-distance networks | Trade, exchange |
| Subsistence expansion | Fishing, small game |
| Planning depth | Seasonal strategies |
| Language | Full syntactic language |

### African Middle Stone Age Evidence

| Site | Age (ka) | Evidence |
|------|----------|----------|
| Blombos Cave | 100-75 | Shell beads, ochre engravings |
| Pinnacle Point | 164 | Heat treatment of stone |
| Klasies River | 120-60 | Fish, shellfish exploitation |
| Howieson's Poort | 80-60 | Backed tools, possible hafting |
| Border Cave | 40-30 | Earliest burials in Africa |

### Blombos Cave (South Africa)

Key evidence for early symbolic behavior:

| Evidence | Age (ka) | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| Engraved ochre | 77 | Geometric patterns |
| Shell beads | 75 | Nassarius shells, drilled |
| Bone tools | 100-70 | Shaped, polished |
| Ochre processing | 100 | "Paint kits" |

### Timing Debate

| Model | Timing of Behavioral Modernity |
|-------|-------------------------------|
| Revolution model | ~50 ka (sudden) |
| Gradualist model | Accumulated over 200+ ka |
| African-first model | Developed in Africa, expressed during dispersal |

Current view favors gradual accumulation with regional variation.

## Genetics of Human Origins

### African Genetic Diversity

| Finding | Implication |
|---------|-------------|
| Most genetic variation in Africa | Origin point |
| Decreasing diversity from Africa | Founder effects during expansion |
| Deep lineages in Africa | Long population history |
| Khoisan deep divergence | ~200-300 ka split |

### Y-Chromosome and mtDNA

| Marker | MRCA Age | Implication |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| Mitochondrial Eve | ~200 ka | All mtDNA coalesces |
| Y-Chromosome Adam | ~275 ka | All Y-chromosomes coalesce |
| Note | Not the same individuals | Statistical ancestors |

### Archaic Admixture

| Source | Non-African Ancestry |
|--------|---------------------|
| Neanderthal | 1-4% (Eurasians) |
| Denisovan | 4-6% (Melanesians) |
| Unknown archaic | ~2% (some African populations) |

## Climate and Environment

### African Environments 300-50 ka

| Period | Climate | Environment |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| MIS 9-7 | Variable | Wet-dry oscillations |
| MIS 6 (glacial) | Cool, arid | Habitat fragmentation |
| MIS 5e (interglacial) | Warm, wet | Corridor expansion |
| MIS 4 (glacial) | Cool, arid | Population bottleneck? |
| MIS 3 | Variable | Sahara pumping |

### "Green Sahara" Phases

Periods when the Sahara was habitable:
- Allowed north-south movement
- Connected African populations
- Enabled exits from Africa
- Climate-driven expansion/contraction

## Population Dynamics

### Estimated Population Sizes

| Time | Population Estimate |
|------|---------------------|
| 100-70 ka | Possibly <10,000 effective |
| 70 ka | Population bottleneck? |
| 50 ka | Expansion begins |
| 10 ka | ~5-10 million |

### Population Bottleneck?

Genetic evidence for population crash:
- Low genetic diversity suggests small ancestral population
- Timing debated: 135-90 ka or 70 ka (Toba?)
- May not have been single event

### African Population Structure

| Group | Divergence (ka) |
|-------|-----------------|
| Khoisan | 200-300 |
| West Africans | ~120 |
| East Africans | ~100 |
| Non-African split | ~70-50 |
