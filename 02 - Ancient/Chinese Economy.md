# Chinese Economy

Ancient China developed a distinctive economic system that combined strong state intervention with sophisticated market activity. Unlike Mediterranean economies, China placed agriculture at the ideological center while treating commerce with suspicion—yet created one of the ancient world's most monetized economies.

## The State-Market Paradox

| Ideology | Practice |
|----------|----------|
| Agriculture supreme | Markets flourished |
| Merchants despised | Trade expanded |
| State control ideal | Private enterprise thrived |
| Autarky valued | Long-distance trade grew |

**China's economy was more interventionist in theory, more commercial in practice, than its ideology suggests.**
