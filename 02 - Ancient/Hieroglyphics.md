# Hieroglyphics

Egyptian hieroglyphics ("sacred carvings" in Greek) were the formal writing system of ancient Egypt, used for over 3,500 years. Combining logographic, alphabetic, and determinative elements, hieroglyphics were employed primarily for monumental inscriptions, religious texts, and formal documents, while cursive scripts served everyday purposes.

## Overview

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Name | "Sacred carved letters" (Greek) |
| Egyptian name | *medu netjer* ("words of god") |
| Origin | c. 3200 BCE |
| Last inscription | 394 CE (Philae) |
| Duration | ~3,600 years |
| Decipherment | 1822 (Champollion) |
| Signs | ~700 common (1,000+ total) |

## Development

### Origins

| Period | Development |
|--------|-------------|
| Pre-3200 BCE | Labels, tags, early signs |
| c. 3200 BCE | Earliest inscriptions |
| Old Kingdom | Fully developed system |
| Question | Independent invention or Mesopotamian influence? |

### Relationship to Cuneiform

| Aspect | Discussion |
|--------|------------|
| Timing | Both appear c. 3200 BCE |
| System | Different approaches |
| Signs | Completely different |
| Direction | Egyptian: various; Cuneiform: left-to-right |
| Conclusion | Probably independent, possibly idea-sharing |
