# Sparta

Sparta represents the anti-commercial extreme of Greek economic organization. Where Athens embraced trade, coinage, and foreign residents, Sparta rejected them all—creating a militarized autarky based on serf labor (helots) and an ideology of austerity. Sparta shows that ancient states could choose radically different economic paths.

## Overview

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Location | Laconia, Peloponnese |
| Peak population | ~8,000 citizens, 200,000+ helots |
| Citizens | Spartiates (full citizens) |
| Government | Mixed (kings, council, assembly) |
| Economy | Agricultural autarky |
| Character | Military state |

| Foreigners | Excluded | Metics welcomed |

| Markets | Limited | Agora central |
| Labor | Helots | Slaves, citizens, metics |
| Ideal | Autarky | Commerce |

### Why This Matters

|--------|-------------|
| Choice existed | Economies aren't inevitable |
| Trade-offs | Military power vs. wealth |
| Ideology shapes economy | Values determine system |
