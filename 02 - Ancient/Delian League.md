# Delian League

The Delian League began as a defensive alliance against Persia and became the Athenian Empire—a system of tribute extraction that funded Athens' golden age. What started with voluntary contributions to a common treasury at Delos ended with forced payments to Athens. The League's transformation from alliance to empire illustrates how economic power creates political dominance.
