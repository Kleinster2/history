# Temple Economy

Temple economies were among history's first large-scale economic institutions—organizing labor, storing surplus, redistributing resources, and recording transactions. In Mesopotamia and Egypt, temples owned vast lands, employed thousands, and managed complex operations. The earliest writing emerged to track temple accounts. Understanding temple economies means understanding how religion and economics intertwined at civilization's origins.
