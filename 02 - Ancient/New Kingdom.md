# New Kingdom (1550-1069 BCE)

The New Kingdom, encompassing Dynasties 18-20, represents ancient Egypt at the height of its power and prestige. After expelling the Hyksos, Egyptian pharaohs built an empire stretching from Nubia to the Euphrates. This era produced some of Egypt's most famous rulers—Hatshepsut, Akhenaten, Tutankhamun, and Ramesses II—and monuments like the Valley of the Kings, Karnak Temple, and Abu Simbel.
