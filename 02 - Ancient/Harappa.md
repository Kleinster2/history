## Economy

### Craft Production Evidence

Harappa is crucial for understanding Indus economic organization:

| Craft | Evidence |
|-------|----------|
| Bead making | Extensive workshops, debris |
| Shell working | Bangles, inlays |
| Pottery | Kilns, standardized forms |
| Metallurgy | Crucibles, slag |
| Seal making | Unfinished seals |

### The "Granaries"

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Structure | 12 units, 15 × 6 m each |
| Location | Near river (transport) |
| Ventilation | Air channels below |
| Interpretation | Grain storage or other use? |

### Working Floors

| Evidence | Interpretation |

| Circular platforms | Grain processing? |
| Near granaries | Linked activities |
| Labor organization | Coordinated work |

### Trade

| Evidence | Implication |
|----------|-------------|
| Seals (many found) | Trade administration |
| Raw materials | Imported lapis, copper |
| Standardized weights | Commercial activity |
| Coastal shells | Long-distance trade |

## Standardization at Harappa

### Weights

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Material | Chert cubical weights |
| System | Same as other Indus sites |
| Sizes | Full range |
| Implication | Centralized standard |

### Bricks

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Ratio | 1:2:4 |
| Same as | Mohenjo-daro, all sites |
| Implication | Shared building code |

### Script

| Feature | Details |
|---------|---------|
| Seals | Many with script |
| Signs | Same as elsewhere |
