# Roman Empire

The Roman Empire was the ancient world's largest unified economy—a Mediterranean-spanning system of trade, taxation, and integration that connected three continents. From 27 BCE (Augustus) to 476 CE (fall of the West), Rome maintained an unprecedented scale of economic activity: standardized currency, protected trade routes, massive infrastructure, and urban networks that wouldn't be matched for over a millennium.
