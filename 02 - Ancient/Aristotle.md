# Aristotle

Aristotle (384-322 BCE) was the first systematic economic thinker. His distinctions between use value and exchange value, natural and unnatural wealth-getting, and his analysis of money's functions shaped economic thought for two millennia. Medieval scholastics, Adam Smith, and Karl Marx all engaged with Aristotle's economic categories.
