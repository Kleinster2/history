# Indus Valley Index

The Indus Valley Civilization (also called Harappan Civilization) was one of the world's earliest urban societies, flourishing in the northwestern regions of South Asia from roughly 3300 to 1300 BCE. At its peak, it was the largest of the ancient civilizations, with over 1,500 known settlements spanning from Afghanistan to Gujarat.

## The Economic Mystery

The Indus Valley presents a profound puzzle for economic history:

| Feature | What We'd Expect | What We Find |
|---------|------------------|--------------|
| Rulers | Palaces, royal tombs | None found |
| Religion | Temples, priests | No clear temples |
| Administration | Written records | Undeciphered script |
| Inequality | Rich/poor housing | Remarkably uniform |
| Trade | Local exchange | Standardized across 1000+ km |

**How did they coordinate a civilization of 5 million people without visible rulers, temples, or readable records?**

## Timeline

| Period | Dates | Characteristics |
|--------|-------|-----------------|
| Early Harappan | 3300-2600 BCE | Regional cultures, proto-urban |
| Mature Harappan | 2600-1900 BCE | Urban peak, standardization |
| Late Harappan | 1900-1300 BCE | Decline, de-urbanization |

## Geography

### The Indus System

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Indus River | Main artery, seasonal flooding |
| Ghaggar-Hakra | "Lost river," now dry |
| Extent | Pakistan, NW India, Afghanistan |
| Area | ~1.3 million km² |
| Climate then | Wetter than today |

### Regions

| Region | Major Sites |
|--------|-------------|
| Sindh | Mohenjo-daro |
| Punjab | Harappa |
| Gujarat | Lothal, Dholavira |
| Rajasthan | Kalibangan |
| Balochistan | Mehrgarh (precursor) |

---

## Major Sites

### Urban Centers

- [[Mohenjo-daro]] - Largest city, "Mound of the Dead"
- [[Harappa]] - Type site, first discovered
- [[Dholavira]] - Water management, signboard
- [[Lothal]] - Port city, dockyard

### Other Important Sites

| Site | Significance |
|------|--------------|
| Kalibangan | Fire altars, plowed field |
| Rakhigarhi | Largest site by area |
| Chanhudaro | Craft production |
| Banawali | Town planning |
| Mehrgarh | Neolithic precursor (7000 BCE) |

## Economy

> See [[Indus Valley Economy]] for full treatment.

### The Standardization Mystery

| Standard | Scale |
|----------|-------|
| Brick ratio | 1:2:4 across ALL sites |
| Weights | Same system everywhere |
| City planning | Grid pattern repeated |
| Script | Same symbols everywhere |

This implies coordination without visible hierarchy.

### Key Economic Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Standardized weights | Cubical, binary/decimal system |
| Seals | 3,500+ found, trade markers |
| No coinage | Weight-based exchange |
| Craft specialization | Beads, metalwork, pottery |
| Long-distance trade | Mesopotamia, Central Asia, Gujarat |

### Trade Networks

| Partner | Evidence |
|---------|----------|
| Mesopotamia | Indus seals found at Ur |
| Oman/Magan | Copper trade |
| Afghanistan | Lapis lazuli |
| Central Asia | Various goods |
| Internal | Standardized across region |

---

## Society

### Urban Planning

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Grid layout | Orthogonal streets |
| Citadel + lower town | Two-part cities |
| Drainage | Sophisticated sewers |
| Wells | Public and private |
| Granaries | Communal storage |

### What's Missing

| Expected Feature | Status |
|------------------|--------|
| Palaces | None identified |
| Royal tombs | None found |
| Monumental temples | Absent |
| War/conquest art | None |
| Named rulers | None known |

### Social Organization Theories

| Theory | Argument |
|--------|----------|
| Merchant republics | Traders ruled collectively |
| Priest-kings | Religious authority (little evidence) |
| Corporate governance | Guild-like organization |
| Heterarchy | Multiple power centers |
| State without kings | Bureaucratic but not monarchic |

---

## Technology and Crafts

### Achievements

| Technology | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| Urban planning | First planned cities |
| Sanitation | Best until Romans |
| Weights/measures | Standardized system |
| Bead making | Sophisticated drilling |
| Metallurgy | Bronze, copper, gold |
| Pottery | Wheel-made, standardized |

### The Script

| Feature | Status |
|---------|--------|
| Signs | ~400-600 |
| Average text | 5 signs |
| Longest | ~26 signs |
| Decipherment | Undeciphered |
| Language | Unknown |

---

## Decline and Collapse

### Theories

| Theory | Evidence |
|--------|----------|
| Climate change | River shifts, drought |
| River diversion | Ghaggar-Hakra dried up |
| Flooding | Some sites show flood damage |
| Aryan invasion | Largely discredited |
| Economic collapse | Trade disruption |
| Gradual transformation | Not sudden end |

### What Happened

| Phase | Development |
|-------|-------------|
| 1900 BCE | Cities shrink |
| 1800-1700 BCE | Standardization breaks down |
| 1500-1300 BCE | Rural, de-urbanized |
| After | Cemetery H culture, regional |
