# Göbekli Tepe

Göbekli Tepe is archaeology's greatest recent surprise—a monumental religious complex built by hunter-gatherers before agriculture. Located in southeastern Turkey, its massive stone pillars with carved animals date to ~9500 BCE, making it the world's oldest known monumental architecture. It challenges the assumption that complex society required farming: here, religion may have driven the Neolithic Revolution.
