# Ashurbanipal

Ashurbanipal was the last great king of [[Assyria]]—a warrior-scholar who combined brutal military campaigns with unprecedented cultural patronage. His library at Nineveh preserved Mesopotamian literature including the [[Epic of Gilgamesh]]. Under his rule, Assyria reached its greatest territorial extent, but the empire collapsed within two decades of his death. Ashurbanipal embodies the contradictions of ancient imperial power.
