# Abu Simbel

Abu Simbel is ancient Egypt's most spectacular monument outside Giza—twin rock-cut temples carved into a Nubian cliff by Ramesses II. The four colossal seated statues of the pharaoh, each 20 meters tall, announced Egyptian power to anyone entering from the south. The temples' modern fame comes from their relocation in the 1960s to save them from the Aswan High Dam—one of archaeology's greatest engineering feats.
