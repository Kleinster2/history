# Mesopotamian Religion

Mesopotamian religion was humanity's first complex theological system—a world of capricious gods, cosmic order, and temple institutions that shaped civilization for three millennia. The great temples were not just religious centers but economic powerhouses that organized labor, redistributed resources, and accumulated wealth. Understanding Mesopotamian religion means understanding how ancient societies explained their world and organized their economies.
