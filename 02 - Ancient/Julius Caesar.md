# Julius Caesar

Gaius Julius Caesar (100-44 BCE) conquered Gaul, crossed the Rubicon, and destroyed the Roman Republic—transforming Mediterranean politics forever. His Gallic Wars enriched Rome with plunder and slaves; his civil war consolidated his power; his dictatorship ended in assassination. Caesar's career exemplifies how conquest, personal ambition, and military power reshaped Roman politics and economy. His heir would establish the Empire.
