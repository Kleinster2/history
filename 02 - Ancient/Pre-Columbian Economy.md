# Pre-Columbian Economy

The pre-Columbian Americas present the most radical alternative to Old World economic assumptions. The Inca Empire—larger than Rome at its peak—operated without money or markets. The Maya used cacao beans as currency. The Aztecs ran one of the ancient world's largest marketplaces. These weren't "primitive" economies waiting for proper development; they were sophisticated systems that chose different paths.

## The Great Experiment

### What the Americas Prove

| Assumption | Americas Counter-Evidence |
|------------|--------------------------|
| Economies need money | Inca had none |
| Economies need markets | Inca had none |
| Wheel is essential | No wheeled transport, still built empires |
| Iron is necessary | Stone, obsidian, bronze worked fine |
| Writing is required | Khipu administered millions |

### Why This Matters

| Point | Implication |
|-------|-------------|
| Independent development | Not one economic path |
| Working alternatives | Different systems can succeed |
| Choice, not necessity | Money/markets were choices |
| Limits of assumptions | Our models are parochial |
