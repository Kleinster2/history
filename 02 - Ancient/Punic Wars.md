# Punic Wars

The Punic Wars (264-146 BCE) were the ancient Mediterranean's definitive conflict—three wars between Rome and [[Carthage]] that determined which power would dominate the western Mediterranean. Rome's ultimate victory destroyed Carthaginian commercial supremacy, gave Rome control of Spain's silver mines and North Africa's grain, and transformed the Roman Republic into a Mediterranean empire. These wars shaped economic history for centuries.
