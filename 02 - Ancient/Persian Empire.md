# Persian Empire

The Persian (Achaemenid) Empire was the ancient world's largest—stretching from Egypt to India under a sophisticated administrative system. Founded by [[Cyrus the Great]], the empire pioneered provincial governance, standardized tribute, built royal roads, and practiced religious tolerance. Persian rule created an integrated economic zone across the Near East, facilitating trade and cultural exchange on an unprecedented scale.
