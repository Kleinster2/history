# Greek Economy

The ancient Greeks created the Mediterranean's most commercialized economy—and the first systematic thinking about economic life. Yet this was also an economy built on slavery, suspicious of profit-seeking, and fragmented among hundreds of independent city-states. Understanding Greek economics means grappling with these contradictions.

## The Greek Paradox

|-------------|------------|
| Coined money spread | No unified currency |
| Active markets | Citizens avoided trade |
| Banking emerged | Interest morally suspect |
| Economic theory | Condemned commerce |
| Commercial sophistication | Based on slave labor |
