# Code of Hammurabi

The Code of Hammurabi is the most complete surviving law code from the ancient world—282 laws covering property, commerce, family, labor, and crime. Inscribed on a black diorite stele, it reveals how Babylonian society actually worked: its markets, its inequalities, its ideas about justice. More than a legal document, it's a window into the economic and social order of the ancient Near East.
