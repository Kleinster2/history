# Osiris

Osiris was ancient Egypt's most important god—ruler of the underworld, judge of the dead, and symbol of resurrection. The Osiris myth shaped Egyptian beliefs about death and afterlife for three millennia. His cult center at [[Abydos]] attracted pilgrims, and every deceased Egyptian sought identification with Osiris. The god's widespread worship supported temple economies, festival industries, and the massive mortuary complex that characterized Egyptian society.
