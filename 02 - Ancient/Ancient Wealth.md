# Ancient Wealth

Who were the rich in the ancient world, and how did they get that way? The sources of great wealth changed dramatically—from temple administrators controlling grain, to landowners extracting rents, to merchants trading luxuries, to Roman magnates combining conquest, slavery, and finance. Understanding ancient fortunes reveals how these economies actually worked.

## The Problem of Measurement

### What We Don't Know

| Challenge | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Currency conversion | Talents, drachmas, sesterces—what's equivalent? |
| Purchasing power | What could money actually buy? |
| Hidden wealth | Not all recorded |
| State vs. personal | Did pharaoh "own" Egypt? |
| Asset valuation | Land, slaves—at what price? |

### What We Can Compare

| Method | Application |
|--------|-------------|
| Labor equivalents | How many years of wages? |
| Land holdings | Acreage controlled |
| Slave ownership | Numbers held |
| Contemporary testimony | Who was called "rich"? |
| Relative scale | Richest in their society |
