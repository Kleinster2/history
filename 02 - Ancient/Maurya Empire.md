# Maurya Empire

The Maurya Empire was ancient India's first great unifier—bringing most of the subcontinent under centralized rule for the first time. Founded by Chandragupta Maurya after Alexander's withdrawal, the empire reached its peak under Ashoka, whose conversion to Buddhism transformed both governance and trade. The Mauryas built roads, standardized measures, and created an administrative system that facilitated commerce across South Asia.
