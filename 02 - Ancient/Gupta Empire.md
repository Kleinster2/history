# Gupta Empire

The Gupta Empire (320-550 CE) presided over India's "Golden Age"—a period of political stability, economic prosperity, and cultural flourishing. Under the Guptas, Indian mathematics, astronomy, literature, and art reached unprecedented heights. Trade networks connected India to Rome, Southeast Asia, and China. The decimal system and concept of zero emerged. The Gupta period shows how political unity could generate cultural and economic achievement.
