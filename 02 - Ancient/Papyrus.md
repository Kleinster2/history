# Papyrus

Papyrus was the ancient world's dominant writing material—a paper-like product made from the papyrus reed that grew abundantly in the Nile Delta. For three millennia, papyrus carried the administrative records, literature, and religious texts of Mediterranean civilizations. Egypt's monopoly on papyrus production made it a valuable export commodity. The material shaped what could be written, preserved, and transmitted.
