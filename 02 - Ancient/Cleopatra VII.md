# Cleopatra VII

Cleopatra VII was the last active ruler of Ptolemaic Egypt—a brilliant politician who used every tool available to preserve her kingdom's independence against Rome. Highly educated, multilingual, and strategically minded, she allied with Julius Caesar and Mark Antony, bore children by both, and nearly created an Eastern empire. Her defeat by Octavian ended both her life and three thousand years of pharaonic Egypt.
