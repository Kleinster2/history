# Persia Index

The Persian empires created the ancient world's most sophisticated systems of imperial administration and taxation before Rome. From the Achaemenid "King of Kings" to the Sasanid "King of Iran," Persian rulers governed vast territories through a combination of tribute extraction, road networks, standardized coinage, and local autonomy that allowed diverse economies to flourish under imperial oversight.
