# Neolithic Revolution

The Neolithic Revolution was humanity's transition from hunting and gathering to farming—the most important change in human history before industrialization. Beginning around 10,000 BCE in the Fertile Crescent, agriculture enabled population growth, permanent settlements, social hierarchy, and eventually civilization. But was it progress? Farmers worked harder, ate worse, and lived more crowded lives than their forager ancestors.

## Overview

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Date | ~10,000-4000 BCE |
| Location | Multiple origins |
| Change | Hunting/gathering → farming |
| Effect | Civilization enabled |
| Term | V. Gordon Childe (1936) |

## What Changed

### Before (Paleolithic)

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Subsistence | Hunting, gathering |
| Settlement | Mobile, seasonal |
| Population | Low density |
| Society | Egalitarian bands |
| Tools | Stone, bone |

### After (Neolithic)

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Subsistence | Farming, herding |
| Settlement | Permanent villages |
| Population | Higher density |
| Society | Hierarchical |
| Tools | Polished stone, pottery |

## Multiple Origins

| Region | Date | Crops/Animals |
|--------|------|---------------|
| [[Fertile Crescent]] | 10,000 BCE | Wheat, barley, sheep, goats |
| China | 8,000 BCE | Rice, millet, pigs |
| Mesoamerica | 7,000 BCE | Maize, beans, squash |
| Andes | 6,000 BCE | Potatoes, llamas |
| Sub-Saharan Africa | 5,000 BCE | Sorghum, yams |
| New Guinea | 7,000 BCE | Taro, bananas |

## Why It Happened

### Explanations

| Theory | Argument |
|--------|----------|
| Population pressure | Too many people |
| Climate change | Younger Dryas, then warming |
| Social/ritual | [[Göbekli Tepe]] model |
| Accident | Gradual, unintentional |
| Optimal conditions | Right time, right place |

### Current View

| Factor | Role |
|--------|------|
| Climate | Holocene warming |
| Available species | Wild wheat, barley |
| Sedentism | Settled first? |
| Social factors | Feasting, religion |
| Multiple causes | Combination |

## The Process

### Stages

| Stage | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Sedentism | Permanent settlement |
| Cultivation | Plant management |
| [[Domestication]] | Genetic change |
| Full agriculture | Dependent on farming |

### Timeline (Fertile Crescent)

| Date | Development |
|------|-------------|
| 12,000 BCE | Natufian sedentism |
| 10,000 BCE | First cultivation |
| 9,000 BCE | Domesticated plants |
| 8,000 BCE | Domesticated animals |
| 7,000 BCE | Farming villages spread |

## Economic Effects

### Production

| Change | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Food surplus | Storage possible |
| Reliability | Less (drought, disease) |
| Labor | More per calorie |
| Output | More per acre |

### Social

| Change | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Sedentism | Accumulate property |
| Surplus | Support non-farmers |
| Hierarchy | Unequal access |
| Specialization | Crafts, priests, rulers |

### Demographic

| Change | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Population growth | Higher fertility |
| Density | More people/area |
| Disease | New epidemics |
| Net effect | More people, worse health |

## The Downside

### Health

| Problem | Evidence |
|---------|----------|
| Shorter stature | Skeletal data |
| More disease | Crowding, animals |
| Worse nutrition | Less varied diet |
| Harder work | More labor required |

### The Question

| View | Argument |
|------|----------|
| Progress | Enabled civilization |
| Mistake | "Worst mistake" (Jared Diamond) |
| Neither | Unintentional, irreversible |

## Spread

### Diffusion

| Mechanism | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Demic | Farmers moved |
| Cultural | Ideas spread |
| Both | Region-dependent |

### To Europe

| Route | Date |
|-------|------|
| Balkans | 7000 BCE |
| Mediterranean | 6000 BCE |
| Central Europe | 5500 BCE |
| Britain | 4000 BCE |

## Long-term Consequences

| Consequence | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| Civilization | Cities, states |
| Writing | Record surplus |
| Inequality | Property, hierarchy |
| Environmental | Deforestation, erosion |
| Disease | Epidemics from animals |
