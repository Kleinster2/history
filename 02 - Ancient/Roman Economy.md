# Roman Economy

The Roman economy was the largest and most integrated economic system of the ancient world. At its peak, it connected Britain to Egypt, Spain to Syria, within a single monetary and legal framework. This was an economy of unprecedented scale—and unprecedented reliance on slave labor, conquest, and extraction.

## The Scale

| GDP | ~$20-25 billion (modern equivalent) |
| Per capita | ~$800 (comparable to 1700s Europe) |
| Population | 60-70 million |
| Territory | 5 million km² |
| Urbanization | 10-15% |
| Monetization | High by ancient standards |
