# Alexander the Great

Alexander III of Macedon (356-323 BCE) conquered the largest empire the ancient world had seen—from Greece to India in just thirteen years. His conquests destroyed the Persian Empire, spread Greek culture across the Near East, and created the Hellenistic world. Alexander's campaigns opened trade routes from the Mediterranean to Central Asia, founded cities that became commercial hubs, and redistributed Persian treasure that stimulated economies throughout the conquered lands.
