# China Index

Ancient China developed one of the world's most influential civilizations largely in isolation from the Western Bronze Age powers. From the Shang dynasty's bronze casting to the Han dynasty's bureaucratic empire, China created distinctive economic and political systems that would shape East Asian history for millennia.

## The Economic Distinctiveness

China's ancient economy developed differently from its Western contemporaries:

| Feature | China | Mesopotamia/Egypt |
|---------|-------|-------------------|
| Bronze use | Ritual vessels, not tools | Tools, weapons |
| Writing origin | Divination | Accounting |
| Coinage | Developed independently | From Lydia |
| State form | Centralized bureaucracy | City-states, empires |
| Land | State allocation | Temple/palace/private |
| Key goods | Silk, jade, bronze | Grain, textiles, metals |
