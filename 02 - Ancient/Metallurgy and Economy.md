# Metallurgy and Economy

Metal transformed ancient economies. Copper, bronze, and then iron enabled new tools, new weapons, and new forms of wealth. The transition from stone to metal, and from bronze to iron, marks two of the great economic revolutions before the modern era—each reshaping production, trade, warfare, and social organization.

## Overview

### The Metal Ages

| Age | Dates | Key Metal | Economic Impact |
|-----|-------|-----------|-----------------|
| Copper Age | 4500-3300 BCE | Copper | First metal tools, ornaments |
| Bronze Age | 3300-1200 BCE | Bronze (Cu+Sn) | Elite control, long-distance trade |
| Iron Age | 1200-500 BCE | Iron | Democratized metal, new empires |

### Why Metals Mattered

| Before Metal | With Metal |
|--------------|------------|
| Stone tools (limited shapes) | Moldable, repairable tools |
| Local materials | Long-distance trade necessary |
| Diffuse power | Elite control of production |
| Limited surplus extraction | Better weapons for states |

---

## The Bronze Age Economy

### Bronze: The First Alloy

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Composition | Copper + tin (typically 10-12% tin) |
| Advantage over copper | Harder, better edge, lower melting point |
| Problem | Tin is rare, geographically concentrated |
| Result | Long-distance trade networks essential |

### Tin Sources and Trade

| Source | Supplied |
|--------|----------|
| Cornwall (Britain) | Mediterranean (via Atlantic/overland) |
| Afghanistan | Mesopotamia, Indus Valley |
| Anatolia | Near East |
| Central Europe | Regional trade |

**Bronze Age economies were built on tin routes—whoever controlled tin controlled power.**

### Economic Implications of Bronze

| Feature | Economic Effect |
|---------|-----------------|
| Complex production | Specialized smiths |
| Raw material scarcity | Elite control |
| Trade necessity | Long-distance networks |
| Prestige goods | Status markers |
| Weapons | Military advantage |

### The Palace Economies

| Civilization | Bronze Economy |
|--------------|----------------|
| Mesopotamia | Temple/palace workshops, tin imports |
| Egypt | State-controlled, copper from Sinai |
| Minoans | Maritime trade, bronze hoards |
| Mycenaeans | Palace inventories, Linear B records |
| Shang China | Ritual bronze casting, royal monopoly |

### Bronze and Inequality

| Effect | Mechanism |
|--------|-----------|
| Elite monopoly | Controlled production, trade |
| Status display | Bronze as prestige marker |
| Warfare | Superior weapons for elites |
| Taxation | Surplus extraction enforced |

**Bronze was the first strategic resource—those who controlled it, ruled.**

## Bronze Age Collapse (c. 1200 BCE)

### What Collapsed

| Feature | Before | After |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Trade networks | Long-distance | Disrupted/broken |
| Palace systems | Centralized control | Fragmented |
| Literacy | Linear B, cuneiform | Lost in some areas |
| Cities | Large, complex | Smaller, simpler |

### Economic Causes/Effects

| Factor | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Trade disruption | Tin routes cut |
| System fragility | Interdependent economies |
| Climate stress | Drought, famine |
| Population movement | Sea Peoples, migrations |

**See:** [[Economic Collapse]] for broader context on collapse patterns.

## The Iron Revolution

### Iron vs. Bronze

| Feature | Bronze | Iron |
|---------|--------|------|
| Raw materials | Rare tin required | Iron ore common |
| Control | Elite monopolies possible | Harder to control |
| Production | Lower temperature | Higher, but doable |
| Accessibility | Limited | Widespread |
| Effect | Reinforced hierarchy | More democratic |

### Why Iron Won

| Advantage | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Abundance | Iron ore everywhere (vs. rare tin) |
| Hardness | Steel (iron + carbon) harder than bronze |
| Cost | Cheaper per unit |
| Availability | Difficult to monopolize |

### The Spread of Iron

| Region | Iron Age Begins | Notes |
|--------|-----------------|-------|
| Anatolia (Hittites) | ~1500 BCE | Early development |
| Near East | ~1200 BCE | Post-collapse spread |
| Mediterranean | ~1000 BCE | Greek Iron Age |
| Europe | ~800 BCE | Hallstatt, La Tène |
| India | ~1000 BCE | Indo-Gangetic plain |
| China | ~600 BCE | Later but intensive |
| Sub-Saharan Africa | ~500 BCE | Independent development |

## Iron Age Economics

### Agricultural Revolution

| Innovation | Effect |
|------------|--------|
| Iron plowshares | Heavier soils cultivable |
| Axes | Faster forest clearance |
| Sickles | More efficient harvest |
| Result | Agricultural expansion |

### Democratization of Tools

| Bronze Age | Iron Age |
|------------|----------|
| Elite warriors with bronze | More soldiers with iron |
| Few bronze tools | Iron tools common |
| Peasants used stone | Peasants use iron |
| Centralized production | Local blacksmiths |

### New State Types

| Feature | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| Larger armies | Iron weapons cheaper |
| New empires | Assyrian, Persian, Roman |
| Cavalry | Iron bits, weapons |
| Naval power | Iron-reinforced ships |

### Trade Changes

| Shift | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Tin routes | Less critical |
| Iron ore trade | More localized |
| Finished goods | Iron tools traded |
| New commodities | Salt, grain become more important |

## China: A Different Path

### Bronze in China

| Feature | Chinese Bronze |
|---------|----------------|
| Use | Primarily ritual vessels |
| Production | State-controlled, massive scale |
| Technique | Advanced piece-mold casting |
| Purpose | Legitimating power, not tools |

### Chinese Iron

| Development | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| Dating | From ~600 BCE |
| Innovation | Cast iron (unique to China) |
| State role | Heavy involvement |
| Scale | Massive production by Han |

### The Chinese Difference

| Feature | China | West |
|---------|-------|------|
| Bronze use | Ritual, not tools | Tools and weapons |
| Iron technique | Cast iron early | Wrought iron |
| State role | Heavy control | More diffuse |
| Agricultural tools | Iron early | Iron later in some areas |

## Economic Legacies

### From Bronze Age

| Legacy | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Long-distance trade | Networks persisted |
| Metallurgical knowledge | Continuous development |
| Social stratification | Reinforced by metal control |
| State power | Models for extraction |

### From Iron Age

| Legacy | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Agricultural expansion | Enabled population growth |
| Tool democratization | More productive peasants |
| New empires | Larger scale possible |
| Urban growth | Supported by iron tools |

### For Economic Progress

| Development | Significance |
|-------------|--------------|
| Specialization | Smiths as specialists |
| Trade | Strategic resource networks |
| Surplus | Metal tools → more production |
| States | Better extraction capability |

## Historical Questions

### Did Bronze Enable Civilization?

| View | Argument |
|------|----------|
| Yes | Bronze → elite power → states |
| No | Civilizations predate bronze (Uruk) |
| Nuanced | Bronze accelerated state formation |

### Did Iron Cause Democracy?

| View | Argument |
|------|----------|
| Ancient view | Hoplites → Greek democracy |
| Modern view | Complex causation |
| Economic | Wider tool access changed power |
