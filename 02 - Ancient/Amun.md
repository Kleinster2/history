# Amun

Amun was ancient Egypt's supreme deity during the New Kingdom—"the hidden one" whose cult center at Thebes (Karnak) controlled vast wealth. What began as a local god became Egypt's most powerful religious institution, with temples owning enormous lands, commanding thousands of workers, and rivaling the pharaoh's power. Amun's priests could make or break dynasties.
