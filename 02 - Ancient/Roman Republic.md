# Roman Republic

The Roman Republic (509-27 BCE) was the period when Rome conquered the Mediterranean through a unique combination of citizen-soldiers, adaptive institutions, and ruthless pragmatism. From a small Italian city-state to master of the ancient world, Rome built an empire while maintaining republican forms—until those forms collapsed under the weight of conquest. The Republic's economic legacy was slave plantations, Italian impoverishment, and enormous wealth flowing to Rome.
