# Egyptian Economy

The Egyptian economy represents history's longest-running experiment in centralized state management. For over 3,000 years, the pharaonic state organized production, collected and redistributed resources, and mobilized labor for monumental projects. Unlike Mesopotamia's temple-market hybrid or Greece's commercial economy, Egypt remained relatively centralized throughout—a different answer to the same economic problems.
