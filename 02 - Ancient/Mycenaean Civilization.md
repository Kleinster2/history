# Mycenaean Civilization

Mycenaean civilization (1600-1100 BCE) was Bronze Age Greece's palace culture—warrior-kings who ruled from fortified citadels like Mycenae and Tiryns, controlled Mediterranean trade networks, and inspired Homer's Trojan War legends. The Mycenaeans adopted Minoan writing (Linear B) and controlled the Aegean after Crete's decline. Their collapse around 1100 BCE plunged Greece into a dark age. Mycenaean economy combined palace control with warfare and trade.
