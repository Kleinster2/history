# Greece Index

Ancient Greece gave the world its first systematic economic thought—the very word "economy" (oikonomia) is Greek. From the Mycenaean palaces through the Classical city-states to the Hellenistic kingdoms, Greek economic systems evolved from palace redistribution to the most commercial economy of the ancient world.
