# Ashoka

Ashoka (reigned ~268-232 BCE) was the [[Maurya Empire]]'s greatest ruler—and history's first emperor to embrace ethical governance based on religious principles. After the brutal Kalinga War, Ashoka converted to Buddhism and propagated his "Dhamma" (righteous conduct) through rock edicts across his empire. His reign saw economic prosperity, trade expansion, and the spread of Buddhism across Asia. Ashoka represents the possibility of moral rule in an ancient empire.
