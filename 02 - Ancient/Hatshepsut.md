# Hatshepsut

Hatshepsut (reigned 1479-1458 BCE) was ancient Egypt's most successful female pharaoh—a woman who ruled as king for over two decades during the New Kingdom's height. Rather than military conquest, her reign emphasized trade (the famous Punt expedition) and monumental construction (Deir el-Bahri). Hatshepsut's economic policies brought prosperity and exotic goods to Egypt, demonstrating that wealth could be built through commerce as well as war.
