# Nubia

Nubia was ancient Africa's great civilization beyond Egypt—spanning the region from southern Egypt to central Sudan. For millennia, Nubia provided Egypt with gold, ivory, and slaves while developing its own distinctive culture. At times subject to Egypt, Nubia also conquered Egypt, ruling as the 25th Dynasty. The kingdoms of Kerma, Kush (Napata and Meroë) demonstrate that complex civilization was not unique to the Nile Delta.
