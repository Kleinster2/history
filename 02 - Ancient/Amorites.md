# Amorites

The nomads who became kings. Originally semi-nomadic pastoralists from the Syrian steppe, the Amorites migrated into Mesopotamia during the late third millennium BCE, eventually founding dynasties across the region—including Babylon. Their story illustrates how outsiders can transform settled civilizations and how pastoral and urban economies interconnect.

## The Deeper Point

The Amorite story illustrates a recurring pattern in economic history: outsiders who conquer but then adopt and extend the institutions of the conquered. The Amorites didn't destroy Mesopotamian civilization; they mastered it, creating larger political units and extending commercial networks while maintaining the bureaucratic and commercial traditions they inherited.

Hammurabi's law code exemplifies this synthesis. Its provisions assume a complex commercial economy with loans, partnerships, wages, and property transactions—all Mesopotamian institutions. But the code's scope and ambition reflect Amorite state-building: a single legal framework for a unified kingdom, replacing the patchwork of local customs.

The pastoral-urban relationship also matters economically. The Amorites weren't purely disruptive invaders; they had long traded with cities, knew their ways, and maintained connections to pastoral networks. Their kingdoms integrated steppe and sown, pastoral and agricultural, mobile and settled. This integration expanded trade networks and economic possibilities.

The [[Institutions and Progress|institutional]] lesson is that conquest can transmit and extend institutions rather than destroy them. The Amorites didn't invent Mesopotamian commercial practices but spread them over larger territories. Later conquerors—Kassites, Assyrians, Persians, Greeks—would follow similar patterns, each extending institutional reach while building on predecessors' achievements.
