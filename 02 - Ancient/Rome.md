# Rome

From city-state to empire to collapse. Rome created the ancient world's largest market economy, built infrastructure that lasted millennia, and left institutional legacies—law, administration, urban planning—that shaped all subsequent Western development. Understanding Rome means understanding how scale and complexity can be achieved, and how they can fail.

## Overview

| Phase | Dates | Character |
|-------|-------|-----------|
| Kingdom | 753-509 BCE | Legendary origins |
| Republic | 509-27 BCE | Expansion, class conflict |

## Economic Significance

|-------------|-------------|
| Scale | Mediterranean-wide market |
| Infrastructure | Roads, aqueducts, ports |
| Law | Contract, property, commerce |
| Urbanization | Million-person city |

## Why Rome Matters for Economic History

| Lesson | Evidence |
|--------|----------|
| Scale is possible | Million-person city, empire-wide trade |
| Institutions matter | Roman law, property, contracts |
| Complexity is fragile | Collapse reversed centuries of development |
| Path dependence | Roman infrastructure used for centuries |

## Comparative Questions

| Question | Relevance |
|----------|-----------|
| Why didn't Rome industrialize? | [[Great Divergence]] question |
| Why did Rome fall? | [[Economic Collapse]] patterns |
| What survived? | [[Economic Persistence]] |
| What was lost? | Living standards, urbanization, trade |

## The Deeper Point

Rome demonstrates both the possibilities and limits of pre-industrial economic development. At its peak, the Roman economy achieved integration, specialization, and living standards not matched in Europe until the 18th century. Roman law created frameworks for property and contract that became foundations of Western commercial law.

But Rome also shows that complexity can collapse. The sophisticated market economy that moved grain from Egypt to Rome, wine from Gaul to Britain, and silk from China to the Mediterranean depended on institutional infrastructure—roads, ports, currency, law enforcement, peace—that proved fragile when tested by plague, invasion, and political instability.

The question for economic history is what made Roman development possible, why it didn't continue, and what we can learn about the conditions for sustained growth. Rome achieved much without sustained innovation—that's both an accomplishment and a ceiling.
