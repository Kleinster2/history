# Dholavira

Dholavira was one of the five largest cities of the Indus Valley Civilization and its most impressive example of water management engineering. Located on an island in the Rann of Kutch (Gujarat), this city survived in an arid environment through sophisticated reservoir systems—an extraordinary investment in infrastructure.
