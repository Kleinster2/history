# Pyramids

The Egyptian pyramids are among the most iconic monuments of the ancient world. Built as royal tombs primarily during the Old and Middle Kingdoms, these structures represented the pharaoh's journey to the afterlife and demonstrated the power of the Egyptian state. The Great Pyramid of Giza, built for Khufu around 2560 BCE, remained the world's tallest structure for over 3,800 years.
