# Çatalhöyük

Çatalhöyük was one of the world's first large settlements—a Neolithic town of perhaps 10,000 people living in densely packed mud-brick houses. Located in central Anatolia, it thrived for nearly two millennia without apparent social hierarchy, public buildings, or streets. People entered houses through roof hatches. The site reveals early urbanization before cities as we know them existed.
