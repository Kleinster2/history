# Ancient Philosophy

Ancient philosophy was humanity's first systematic attempt to understand the world through reason rather than myth. Greek thinkers asked questions that still define philosophy: What is real? What can we know? How should we live? Their answers shaped Western thought for millennia and continue to influence how we think about ethics, politics, science, and meaning.
