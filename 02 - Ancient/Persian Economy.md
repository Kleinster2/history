# Persian Economy

The Persian empires pioneered large-scale imperial economy—the systematic extraction of tribute from conquered territories through standardized administration. From the Achaemenid tribute lists carved at Persepolis to the Sasanid silk trade with China, Persian rulers demonstrated how empires could profit from diversity while maintaining economic stability across vast distances.

## The Imperial Economic Model

### Core Principle: Tribute Not Transformation

| Persian Approach | Difference from Others |
|------------------|----------------------|
| Extract tribute | Don't restructure local economy |
| Allow local currencies | Alongside royal coinage |
| Use local elites | Satraps with autonomy |
| Maintain diversity | Unified only at top |

### What Made It Work

| Factor | Mechanism |
|--------|-----------|
| Infrastructure | Roads for communication |
| Standardization | Royal coinage |
| Flexibility | Local adaptation |
| Military presence | Garrisons |
| Royal ideology | King of Kings legitimacy |
