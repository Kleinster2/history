# Greek Coinage

The invention of coinage in Lydia (~600 BCE) and its rapid adoption across the Greek world was one of history's great economic accelerators. Standardized metal coins—guaranteed by state stamp—solved the fundamental problem of exchange: how do you trade with strangers? Before coins, every transaction required weighing metal, assessing purity, and trusting counterparties. Coins replaced all of this with a single glance at a stamp. The result was an explosion of market activity, the birth of retail commerce, and the first economies where ordinary people regularly used money.

## Origins: Lydia

### The Innovation

## Denominations and Daily Life

### Athenian System

| Denomination | Value | What It Bought |
|-------------|-------|----------------|
| Talent | 6,000 drachmas | A warship |
| Mina | 100 drachmas | Substantial sum |
| Drachma | 6 obols | Day's skilled wage |
| Obol | 1/6 drachma | Basic meal |
| Half-obol | — | Smallest transaction |

### What This Means

Coins penetrated deeply into [[Greek Economy|Greek daily life]]. Even laborers and slaves handled money. This is fundamentally different from ancient Near Eastern economies where silver was weighed and used mainly by elites and institutions. Greek coinage democratized exchange.

## Legacy

### What Greek Coinage Created

| Innovation | Modern Descendant |
|------------|-------------------|
| State-guaranteed money | All national currencies |
| Denomination system | Dollars/cents, pounds/pence |
| International currency (owl) | Dollar as reserve currency |

| Coin as propaganda | Faces on bills |

### The Deeper Point

Coinage didn't just make trade easier—it made *market society* possible. When everyone uses money, everything gets a price, everyone can compare values, and economic calculation becomes universal. The Greek invention of coins is the invention of the price system itself—the information technology that makes complex economies function.
