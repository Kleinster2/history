# Alphabets

The alphabet was one of humanity's great simplifications. Where cuneiform needed hundreds of signs and Chinese thousands, the alphabet reduced writing to 20-30 symbols representing sounds. This democratized literacy, spread along trade routes, and became the basis for most of the world's writing systems. A Phoenician merchant innovation became the foundation of Greek, Latin, Arabic, Hebrew, and countless other scripts.

## Overview

### What Makes an Alphabet

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Principle | One sign = one sound (phoneme) |
| Size | 20-30 symbols (vs. hundreds/thousands) |
| Learning | Easier than logographic systems |
| Flexibility | Can write any word |

### Before Alphabets

| System | Signs | Type |
|--------|-------|------|
| Cuneiform | 600+ | Syllabic + logographic |
| Hieroglyphics | 700+ | Logographic + phonetic |
| Linear B | 90+ | Syllabic |
| Chinese | Thousands | Logographic |

## Origins

### The Proto-Sinaitic Script (c. 1800 BCE)

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Location | Sinai Peninsula |
| Creators | Semitic workers in Egyptian mines |
| Principle | Adapted Egyptian signs for sounds |
| Acrophony | Sign represents first sound of word |
| Example | "House" (bayt) → sign for /b/ |

### The Key Innovation

| Egyptian Sign | Meaning | Semitic Use |
|---------------|---------|-------------|
| 𓉐 (house) | "house" | /b/ (from *bayt*) |
| 💧 (water) | "water" | /m/ (from *mayim*) |
| 👁 (eye) | "eye" | /ʕ/ (from *ʕayn*) |

**Taking complex Egyptian signs and using them for just their first sound—radical simplification.**

## The Phoenician Alphabet

### Development

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Date | c. 1050 BCE (mature form) |
| Place | Phoenician city-states (Lebanon) |
| Users | Merchants, traders |
| Signs | 22 consonants |
| Direction | Right to left |

### The Letters

| Letter | Name | Sound | Origin |
|--------|------|-------|--------|
| 𐤀 | Aleph | /ʔ/ | Ox head |
| 𐤁 | Beth | /b/ | House |
| 𐤂 | Gimel | /g/ | Camel/throwing stick |
| 𐤃 | Daleth | /d/ | Door |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |

### Why Phoenicians?

| Factor | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Trade | Needed efficient record-keeping |
| Multilingual | Dealt with many languages |
| Practical | Merchants, not scribes |
| Networks | Spread it through commerce |

**The alphabet spread along trade routes—commerce drove literacy.**

## Spread of the Alphabet

### The Phoenician Family Tree

```
Proto-Sinaitic (c. 1800 BCE)
       ↓
Proto-Canaanite (c. 1400 BCE)
       ↓
Phoenician (c. 1050 BCE)
    ↙     ↘
Greek    Aramaic
  ↓         ↓
Latin    Hebrew, Arabic
  ↓      Brahmi → Indian scripts
Western
scripts
```

### Geographic Spread

| Direction | Scripts |
|-----------|---------|
| West | Greek → Latin → European scripts |
| East | Aramaic → Hebrew, Arabic, Syriac |
| South | South Arabian → Ethiopic |
| Far East | Aramaic → Brahmi → Indian, Southeast Asian |

## The Greek Adaptation

### The Crucial Innovation: Vowels

| Phoenician | Greek Use |
|------------|-----------|
| Consonants only | Added vowels |
| Aleph (glottal stop) | Alpha (a) |
| He (h) | Epsilon (e) |
| Yodh (y) | Iota (i) |
| Ayin (pharyngeal) | Omicron (o) |

**Greeks repurposed consonants their language didn't need as vowels—creating the first true alphabet.**

### Why It Mattered

| Feature | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| Complete representation | Every sound written |
| Unambiguous | No guessing vowels |
| Learning | Even easier |
| Literature | Enabled Homer to be written down |

### Greek Alphabet

| Letter | Name | Sound |
|--------|------|-------|
| Α α | Alpha | a |
| Β β | Beta | b |
| Γ γ | Gamma | g |
| Δ δ | Delta | d |
| Ε ε | Epsilon | e |
| ... | ... | ... |

### Date and Spread

| Event | Date |
|-------|------|
| Adoption from Phoenician | c. 800 BCE |
| Earliest inscriptions | c. 750 BCE |
| Standardization | c. 400 BCE (Ionic) |
| Spread | Greek colonies, Alexander |

## The Latin Alphabet

### From Greek to Latin

| Path | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Greek colonies in Italy | Brought alphabet |
| Etruscan adaptation | Intermediary |
| Latin adoption | c. 700 BCE |
| Modifications | Added/dropped letters |

### Latin Letters

| Added | Dropped |
|-------|---------|
| G (from C) | Θ, Φ, Χ (not needed) |
| Y, Z (later, for Greek words) | Some Etruscan letters |

### Spread with Rome

| Period | Reach |
|--------|-------|
| Republic | Italy, Western Mediterranean |
| Empire | Western Europe, North Africa |
| Christianity | Spread with Bible, Church |
| Colonialism | Global |
