# Book of the Dead

The Book of the Dead was ancient Egypt's guide to the afterlife—a collection of spells, prayers, and instructions to help the deceased navigate the underworld and achieve eternal life. Commissioned by those who could afford it, these papyrus scrolls represent both religious belief and economic investment in death. The texts reveal Egyptian cosmology and the mortuary industry that served it.
