# Mycenae

Bronze Age Greece's palace economy. From roughly 1600 to 1100 BCE, Mycenaean civilization dominated the Aegean, building massive fortifications, trading across the Mediterranean, and operating palace-centered economies. Their sudden collapse around 1200 BCE—part of the wider [[Bronze Age Collapse]]—plunged Greece into a dark age lasting centuries.

## Overview

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Period | ~1600-1100 BCE |
| Center | Mycenae (Peloponnese) |
| Other centers | Tiryns, Pylos, Thebes, Athens |
| Writing | Linear B (early Greek) |
| End | Collapse ~1200-1100 BCE |

## Economic System

### The Palace Economy

| Feature | Function |
|---------|----------|
| Palace | Administrative center |
| Redistribution | Collect, store, allocate |
| Records | Linear B tablets |
| Crafts | Palace-controlled workshops |
| Land | Palace, temples, private holdings |

### How It Worked

| Step | Process |
|------|---------|
| Collection | Produce brought to palace |
| Storage | Centralized granaries, storerooms |
| Recording | Scribes track everything |
| Allocation | Distributed as needed |
| Craft production | Assigned to specialists |

### Linear B Records

| Content | Information |
|---------|-------------|
| Inventories | Livestock, grain, oil, textiles |
| Personnel | Workers, their tasks |
| Land tenure | Holdings, obligations |
| Offerings | Religious allocations |
| Military | Chariots, weapons |

## Trade Networks

### Mycenaean Reach

| Region | Trade Goods |
|--------|-------------|
| Crete | Continued Minoan connections |
| Cyprus | Copper |
| Levant | Luxury goods, textiles |
| Egypt | Diplomatic exchange |
| Italy, Sicily | Western expansion |
| Anatolia | Troy and beyond |

### What They Traded

| Export | Import |
|--------|--------|
| Pottery | Metals (copper, tin) |
| Olive oil | Gold, ivory |
| Textiles | Lapis lazuli |
| Perfumed oils | Amber (from Baltic) |

### The Uluburun Shipwreck

| Feature | Evidence |
|---------|----------|
| Date | ~1300 BCE |
| Cargo | Copper, tin, glass, ivory, ebony |
| Origin | Multiple regions |
| Significance | Shows trade network complexity |

## Production

### Agriculture

| Product | Importance |
|---------|------------|
| Grain | Staple food |
| Olives | Oil for food, light, export |
| Wine | Consumption, ritual, export |
| Livestock | Sheep especially (wool) |

### Crafts

| Craft | Organization |
|-------|--------------|
| Metalwork | Palace workshops, bronze weapons |
| Textiles | Large-scale wool production |
| Pottery | Standardized, widely traded |
| Perfume | Scented oils, export specialty |

### The Textile Industry

| Scale | Evidence |
|-------|----------|
| Large flocks | Thousands of sheep recorded |
| Specialized labor | Weavers, carders, spinners |
| Quality grades | Different cloth types |
| Export | Major trade good |

## Social Structure

### Hierarchy

| Level | Role |
|-------|------|
| Wanax | King, supreme authority |
| Lawagetas | Military leader |
| Basileus | Local chiefs |
| Scribes | Record-keepers |
| Craftsmen | Specialized producers |
| Agricultural workers | Majority |
| Slaves | Do-e-ro/do-e-ra in Linear B |

### Land Tenure

| Type | Character |
|------|-----------|
| Palace land | Directly controlled |
| Temple land | Religious estates |
| Private holdings | Subject to obligations |
| Communal | Village holdings |

## The Collapse

### What Happened (~1200-1100 BCE)

| Event | Evidence |
|-------|----------|
| Destructions | Palaces burned |
| Depopulation | Sites abandoned |
| Writing lost | Linear B disappears |
| Trade cessation | Networks collapse |
| Dark Age | Follows for centuries |

### Theories

| Theory | Mechanism |
|--------|-----------|
| Sea Peoples | Raids and invasions |
| Internal revolt | Social conflict |
| Systems collapse | Interconnected failure |
| Climate | Drought, crop failure |
| Earthquakes | Geological events |

### Likely: Multiple Factors

| Factor | Contribution |
|--------|--------------|
| Trade disruption | Affected metal supply |
| External pressure | Sea Peoples, migrations |
| Internal stress | Palace system fragility |
| Cascade | Failures compounded |

## Legacy

### What Was Lost

| Loss | Duration |
|------|----------|
| Writing | ~400 years |
| Monumental architecture | Centuries |
| Long-distance trade | Reduced to local |
| Complex organization | Simpler societies |

### What Survived

| Continuity | Form |
|------------|------|
| Greek language | Spoken, later rewritten |
| Some sites | Reduced occupation |
| Legends | Homer's epics preserve memory |
| Basic skills | Agriculture, crafts |

### Connection to Classical Greece

| Element | Link |
|---------|------|
| Homer | Mycenaean settings, memories |
| Religion | Some gods, practices continue |
| Place names | Many survive |
| But | Institutional discontinuity |

## The Deeper Point

Mycenae demonstrates both the achievements and fragility of [[Institutions and Progress|palace economies]]. The system could coordinate large-scale production—thousands of sheep, hundreds of textile workers, extensive trade networks—but depended on centralized administration. When palaces fell, the entire system collapsed.

The Linear B tablets reveal sophisticated economic management: detailed records of inputs, outputs, obligations, allocations. This was planned economy avant la lettre, with scribes tracking everything from individual sheep to workshop assignments. The coordination was impressive; the vulnerability was hidden.

The collapse illustrates systemic risk in interconnected economies. Mycenaean palaces depended on trade for essential inputs, especially tin for bronze. They depended on each other for defense and exchange. When the system broke at any point—whether through invasion, drought, or internal conflict—the interdependencies transmitted failure. The whole was more fragile than its parts.

The subsequent Dark Age shows that economic complexity can be lost. Writing, administration, long-distance trade, monumental construction—all disappeared for centuries. The Greeks who eventually rebuilt knew the Mycenaeans only through legend. This wasn't gradual decline but civilizational discontinuity.

The recovery, when it came, took different form. Classical Greece developed different institutions: city-states rather than palace kingdoms, alphabetic writing rather than syllabic, trade through independent merchants rather than palace redistribution. The Mycenaean achievement was not foundation but memory—proof that Greeks had once been great, inspiration for future greatness on different institutional bases.
