# Minoan Civilization

Minoan civilization was Bronze Age Europe's first great culture—a maritime power centered on Crete that dominated Aegean trade from roughly 2700-1450 BCE. The Minoans built elaborate palaces at Knossos, Phaistos, and elsewhere, developed sophisticated art, and created two writing systems (Linear A, undeciphered, and its successor Linear B). Their commercial networks connected Egypt, the Levant, and the Aegean. The civilization's sudden collapse remains debated.
