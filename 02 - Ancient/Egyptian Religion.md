# Egyptian Religion

Egyptian religion was a complex polytheistic system that permeated every aspect of ancient Egyptian life for over 3,000 years. Far more than spiritual belief, religion was intertwined with the state, economy, and daily existence. Temples functioned as major economic institutions, controlling vast agricultural lands and employing thousands, while the afterlife industry drove significant craft production and trade.
