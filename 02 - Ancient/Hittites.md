# Hittites

The Hittites built one of the Bronze Age's great powers from their Anatolian homeland. They were among the first to work iron, fought Egypt to a standstill at Kadesh, and developed sophisticated diplomacy and legal codes. Their empire collapsed in the Bronze Age catastrophe (~1178 BCE), but Hittite successor states preserved their culture for centuries.
