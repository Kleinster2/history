# Library of Alexandria

The Library of Alexandria was the ancient world's greatest repository of knowledge—founded by the Ptolemies to collect all books ever written. At its peak, it held hundreds of thousands of scrolls covering every field of knowledge. The library made Alexandria the intellectual capital of the Mediterranean, attracting scholars who advanced mathematics, astronomy, geography, and literature. Its destruction—gradual rather than sudden—represents incalculable loss.
