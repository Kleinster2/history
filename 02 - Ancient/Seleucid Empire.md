# Seleucid Empire

The Seleucid Empire was the largest of Alexander's successor states—inheriting the vast territories from Anatolia to Central Asia. Founded by Seleucus I, the empire faced constant challenges: too large to control, pressed by Ptolemies, Parthians, and Rome. Despite gradual territorial loss, the Seleucids spread Hellenistic culture across the Near East and maintained crucial trade routes connecting Mediterranean to India.
