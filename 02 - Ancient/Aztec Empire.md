# Aztec Empire

The Aztec Empire offers a striking contrast to the Inca: both were vast American empires conquered by Spain, but their economic systems were opposites. While the Inca had no money or markets, the Aztecs had one of the largest marketplaces in the world (Tlatelolco), multiple forms of currency, and a sophisticated commercial economy layered with a massive tribute system. They show that New World economies were not uniformly "primitive"—Aztec markets impressed the Spanish conquistadors.
