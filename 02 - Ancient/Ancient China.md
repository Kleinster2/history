# Ancient China

Ancient China developed one of history's most durable civilizations—a continuous tradition from the Shang dynasty bronze-workers through the Han empire that would influence East Asia for millennia. China pioneered paper, silk, iron casting, and centralized bureaucracy. The Han dynasty (202 BCE-220 CE) was Rome's eastern counterpart: a vast empire at the other end of the Silk Road.
