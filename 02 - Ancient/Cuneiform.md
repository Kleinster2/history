# Cuneiform

Cuneiform is the earliest known writing system, developed in Mesopotamia around 3400 BCE. Named for its wedge-shaped marks (Latin *cuneus* = wedge), cuneiform was used for over 3,000 years to write multiple languages and record everything from administrative accounts to epic literature.

## Overview

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Origin | Southern Mesopotamia (Sumer) |
| Earliest | c. 3400-3100 BCE (Uruk) |
| Latest | 75 CE (astronomical text) |
| Duration | ~3,500 years |
| Languages | Sumerian, Akkadian, Hittite, others |
| Medium | Clay tablets |
| Decipherment | 1850s CE |

## Development

### Stages

| Stage | Date | Characteristics |
|-------|------|-----------------|
| Proto-cuneiform | 3400-3000 BCE | Pictographic, numerical |
| Archaic | 3000-2600 BCE | Becoming abstract |
| Classical Sumerian | 2600-2000 BCE | Full syllabic system |
| Old Babylonian | 2000-1600 BCE | Standardized |
| Middle/Late periods | 1600-75 CE | Continued evolution |

### From Pictures to Wedges

| Change | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Pictographs | Early signs resembled objects |
| Rotation | Signs rotated 90 degrees |
| Simplification | Reduced to essential strokes |
| Abstraction | Lost pictorial quality |
| Wedges | Standardized wedge shapes |

## How It Works

### Sign Types

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| Logograms | One sign = one word | 𒀭 = god/AN |
| Syllables | One sign = one syllable | ba, ab, bab |
| Determinatives | Category markers | DINGIR before god names |
| Phonetic complements | Clarify pronunciation | Added to logograms |

### Complexity

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Polyvalence | One sign, multiple readings |
| Homophony | Multiple signs, same sound |
| Sign count | 600-1,000 signs in use |
| Context | Meaning from surrounding text |

### Example

The sign 𒀭 can be read:
- AN = sky
- DINGIR = god
- ilu = god (Akkadian)
- Or as determinative before divine names
