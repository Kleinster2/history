# Mesopotamian Economy

Mesopotamia pioneered many economic institutions still with us today: writing (invented for accounting), contracts, interest rates, standardized weights, and professional merchants. Unlike Egypt's centralized redistribution, Mesopotamia developed a hybrid system where temples, palaces, and private enterprise coexisted—creating the first recognizable market economy alongside institutional redistribution.
