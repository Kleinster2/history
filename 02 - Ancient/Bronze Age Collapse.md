# Bronze Age Collapse

The Bronze Age Collapse (~1200-1150 BCE) was the ancient world's great catastrophe—the simultaneous collapse of the interconnected civilizations of the eastern Mediterranean. Within decades, the Hittite Empire fell, Mycenaean Greece collapsed, Egyptian power contracted, and cities across the Levant were destroyed. Trade networks dissolved, writing disappeared from Greece, and population declined sharply. This collapse demonstrates how interconnected economies can fail together.

## Overview

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Period | ~1200-1150 BCE |
| Region | Eastern Mediterranean |
| Victims | Hittites, Mycenaeans, others |
| Survivors | Egypt (weakened), Assyria |
| Effect | Dark Age follows |

## The World Before

### Interconnected Civilizations

| Power                                        | Character        |
| -------------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| [[New Kingdom Egypt]]                        | New Kingdom peak |
| [[Hittites]]                                 | Anatolian empire |
| [[Mycenaean Civilization\|Mycenaean Greece]] | Palace economies |
| [[Assyria]]                                  | Rising power     |
| [[Cyprus]]                                   | Copper trade     |
| [[Ugarit]]                                   | Trading hub      |

### Trade Networks

| Good | Route |
|------|-------|
| Copper | Cyprus, Anatolia |
| Tin | Afghanistan, distant |
| Gold | Egypt, Nubia |
| Textiles | Various |
| Grain | Egypt, others |
| Luxury goods | Throughout |

### Political System

| Feature | Character |
|---------|-----------|
| "Club of Great Powers" | Egypt, Hatti, etc. |
| Diplomatic marriages | Connections |
| Gift exchange | Royal |
| Treaties | International law |

## What Collapsed

### Destroyed

| Civilization | Fate |
|--------------|------|
| Hittite Empire | Completely destroyed |
| Mycenaean palaces | All destroyed |
| Ugarit | Destroyed, never rebuilt |
| Levantine cities | Many destroyed |
| Cyprus towns | Destroyed |

### Survived (Weakened)

| Power | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Egypt | Contracted, survived |
| Assyria | Temporarily weakened |
| Babylon | Survived |

## Causes Debated

### Possible Factors

| Theory | Evidence |
|--------|----------|
| Sea Peoples | Egyptian records |
| Drought/climate | Paleoclimate data |
| Earthquakes | Destruction layers |
| Internal revolt | Social evidence |
| System collapse | Interconnection |

### Sea Peoples

| Group | Identity |
|-------|----------|
| Egyptian term | "Peoples of the Sea" |
| Composition | Various groups |
| Origin | Debated |
| Role | Invaders or refugees? |

### Climate Change

| Evidence | Indication |
|----------|------------|
| Pollen | Drought conditions |
| Tree rings | Dry period |
| Letters | Famine mentioned |
| Duration | Decades |

### Systems Collapse

| Theory | Argument |
|--------|----------|
| Interconnection | Made vulnerable |
| Complexity | Fragile |
| Cascade | Failures spread |
| Modern parallel | Cautionary tale |

## The Collapse

### Timeline

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| ~1250 BCE | Tensions visible |
| ~1207 BCE | Libyan attack on Egypt |
| ~1200 BCE | Hittite collapse |
| ~1186 BCE | Sea Peoples attack Egypt |
| ~1175 BCE | Egyptian victory, but exhausted |
| ~1150 BCE | Collapse complete |

### Ugarit Letters

| Content | Significance |
|---------|--------------|
| Urgent requests | For grain |
| Ship reports | Enemy threats |
| Final letters | Never answered |
| Evidence | Real-time collapse |

## Consequences

### Dark Age

| Feature | Duration |
|---------|----------|
| Greece | ~400 years |
| Writing loss | Linear B forgotten |
| Population | Sharp decline |
| Trade | Collapsed |
| Complexity | Reduced |

### Long-term Effects

| Change         | Result                      |
| -------------- | --------------------------- |
| [[Iron Age]]   | New technology              |
| Alphabet       | [[Phoenicians\|Phoenician]] |
| New powers     | [[Ancient Israel]], Phoenicia, later Greece |
| Trade recovery | Centuries later             |

The collapse was creative destruction. The palace economies had to fail for new systems to emerge: Phoenician traders filled the commercial vacuum, Israelites established themselves in the Canaanite power void, and Greece eventually re-emerged with city-states instead of palaces.

## Economic Lessons

### Interconnection Risk

| Lesson | Modern Parallel |
|--------|-----------------|
| Trade dependency | Disruption cascades |
| Specialization | Vulnerability |
| Complexity | Fragility |
| Resilience | Local capacity |

### Recovery

| Process | Character |
|---------|-----------|
| Slow | Centuries |
| Different | New systems |
| Iron | Replaced bronze |
| Decentralization | Initially |

## Archaeological Evidence

### Destruction Layers

| Site | Evidence |
|------|----------|
| Mycenae | Fire destruction |
| Troy | Level VIIa destroyed |
| Hattusa | Burned, abandoned |
| Ugarit | Destruction, letters |
