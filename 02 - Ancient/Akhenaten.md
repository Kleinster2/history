# Akhenaten

Akhenaten was Egypt's "heretic pharaoh"—a ruler who attempted a religious revolution, abandoning traditional gods for worship of the sun disk Aten. He built a new capital, revolutionized art, and shook Egypt's religious establishment. His reforms collapsed immediately after his death, and later Egyptians erased his memory. Yet his reign remains one of the most fascinating episodes in ancient history.
