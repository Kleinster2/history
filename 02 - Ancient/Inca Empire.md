# Inca Empire

The Inca Empire (Tawantinsuyu) was the largest empire in pre-Columbian America and the most radical economic experiment in human history. Covering 2 million km² and 12 million people, it operated without money, markets, or written language—proving that economic complexity doesn't require the institutions we often assume essential.

| Period | 1438-1533 CE |
