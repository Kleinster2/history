# Cyprus

Cyprus has been a strategic prize for three millennia—first for copper, then for location. The island gave the world its word for copper (Latin *cuprum*, from *Cyprium aes*) and served as a crucial trade node from the Bronze Age through the Venetian period. Its history demonstrates how geography creates persistent economic value: whoever controlled Cyprus controlled eastern Mediterranean trade routes.
