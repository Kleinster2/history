# Karnak

Karnak is the largest temple complex ever built, covering over 200 acres on the east bank of the Nile at ancient Thebes (modern Luxor). For nearly 2,000 years, pharaohs expanded this sacred precinct dedicated primarily to Amun-Ra. Beyond its religious significance, Karnak was one of the ancient world's largest economic institutions, controlling vast agricultural estates, workshops, and trade networks.
