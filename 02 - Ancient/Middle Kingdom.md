# Middle Kingdom (2055-1650 BCE)

The Middle Kingdom, spanning Dynasties 11-13, is considered the classical age of Egyptian civilization. After the chaos of the First Intermediate Period, Mentuhotep II reunified Egypt, inaugurating an era of artistic refinement, literary achievement, and territorial expansion into Nubia. Middle Kingdom literature and art set standards that later Egyptians revered as the height of their culture.
