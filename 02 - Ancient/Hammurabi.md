# Hammurabi

Hammurabi (reigned 1792-1750 BCE) was the sixth king of Babylon's First Dynasty—best known for his law code, one of the oldest surviving legal texts. But Hammurabi was also an empire-builder who unified Mesopotamia under Babylonian rule, and his laws reveal a sophisticated commercial economy with regulated prices, wages, and contracts. The Code of Hammurabi shows how law structured ancient economic life.
