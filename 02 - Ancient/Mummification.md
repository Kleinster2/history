# Mummification

Mummification was ancient Egypt's distinctive mortuary practice—the preservation of bodies for eternal life through complex chemical and ritual processes. Developed over three millennia, mummification required specialized knowledge, expensive materials, and substantial labor. The practice reveals Egyptian religious beliefs and created an entire mortuary industry that employed embalmers, priests, coffin-makers, and tomb builders. Death in Egypt was big business.
