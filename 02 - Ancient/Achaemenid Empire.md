# Achaemenid Empire

The Achaemenid Empire was the first true world empire—a multi-ethnic, multi-lingual state stretching from Egypt to India. Founded by Cyrus the Great, perfected by Darius I, it pioneered imperial administration: satrapies, royal roads, standardized coinage, and tribute systems that would influence every subsequent empire. At its height, it ruled perhaps 44% of the world's population.
