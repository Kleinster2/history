# Diocletian

Diocletian ended Rome's "Crisis of the Third Century" and restructured the empire for survival. His reforms—the Tetrarchy, price controls, tax reforms, and administrative reorganization—created a new kind of Roman state: more bureaucratic, more authoritarian, and more economically controlled. Whether he saved the empire or created a system that couldn't last remains debated.
