# Ancient Israel

Ancient Israel emerged in the Canaanite highlands during the [[Bronze Age Collapse]]—one of the small polities that filled the vacuum left by retreating empires. Never a great power, Israel's significance lies elsewhere: survival strategies among empires, the Temple as economic institution, early debt-forgiveness concepts, and the diaspora networks that would shape medieval commerce. Its history demonstrates how a small state navigates between great powers.
