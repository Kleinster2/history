# Deir el-Medina

Deir el-Medina was an Egyptian village of tomb workers—the craftsmen who carved and decorated the royal tombs in the Valley of the Kings. What makes it extraordinary is preservation: thousands of ostraca (pottery shards) and papyri record daily life in detail. We know these workers' wages, their strikes for back pay, their lawsuits, and their love letters. It's ancient history's best window into working-class life.
