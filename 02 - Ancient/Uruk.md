# Uruk

Uruk (modern Warka, biblical Erech) was the first true city in human history and the birthplace of writing. At its peak around 3000 BCE, it was the largest settlement in the world, with a population of 40,000-80,000 people. Uruk gave its name to an entire archaeological period (4000-3100 BCE) and was home to the legendary king Gilgamesh.
