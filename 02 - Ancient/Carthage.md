# Carthage

Carthage was the Mediterranean's greatest trading power before Rome—a Phoenician colony that became an empire. Carthaginian merchants dominated western Mediterranean trade for centuries, building wealth through commerce rather than conquest. The Punic Wars between Carthage and Rome were clashes between two civilizational models: merchant republic versus military republic. Rome won, and Carthage was destroyed so completely that we see it only through Roman eyes.
