# Nineveh

Nineveh was the greatest city of the Neo-Assyrian Empire and one of the largest cities of the ancient world. Located on the Tigris River opposite modern Mosul, Iraq, it served as the Assyrian capital from 705 to 612 BCE. Famous for its massive palaces, the Library of Ashurbanipal, and its dramatic destruction, Nineveh became a byword for imperial power and divine judgment in biblical tradition.
