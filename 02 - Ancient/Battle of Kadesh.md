# Battle of Kadesh

The Battle of Kadesh (1274 BCE) was the ancient world's largest chariot battle—Egyptians vs. Hittites fighting for control of Syria. Neither side won decisively, though both claimed victory. The real significance came after: the world's first recorded peace treaty between Ramesses II and Hattusili III. Kadesh demonstrates how Bronze Age powers balanced war and diplomacy.
