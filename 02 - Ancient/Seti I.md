# Seti I

Seti I (reigned 1290-1279 BCE) was the second pharaoh of Egypt's Nineteenth Dynasty and father of [[Ramesses II]]. His reign restored Egyptian power after the turmoil following Akhenaten, recovering territories in Syria-Palestine and building magnificent monuments. The temple at [[Abydos]] with its famous King List and the beginning of the great hypostyle hall at Karnak demonstrate the economic recovery and artistic excellence of his reign.
