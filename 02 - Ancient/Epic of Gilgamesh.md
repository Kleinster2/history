# Epic of Gilgamesh

The Epic of Gilgamesh is humanity's oldest surviving major literary work—a Mesopotamian poem about a king who seeks immortality and finds wisdom instead. Written on clay tablets over millennia, it includes a flood story that predates and parallels the biblical account. The epic reveals much about ancient Mesopotamian society, religion, and the human confrontation with mortality.
