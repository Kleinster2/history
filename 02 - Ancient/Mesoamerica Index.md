# Pre-Columbian Americas Index

The pre-Columbian Americas developed sophisticated economies entirely independent of the Old World—proving that economic complexity can emerge through radically different paths. No iron, no wheel (for transport), no draft animals (except llamas), no writing (in the Andes), yet the Inca ran the largest empire in the Western Hemisphere without money or markets.

## The Economic Alternative

| Feature | Old World | Americas |
|---------|-----------|----------|
| Draft animals | Horses, oxen, donkeys | None (llamas carry only) |
| Metal tools | Bronze, iron | Limited copper, bronze |
| Wheel | Transport, pottery | Pottery, toys only |
| Currency | Coins common | Cacao, cloth, or none |
| Markets | Universal | Mesoamerica yes, Inca no |
| Writing | Widespread | Mesoamerica only |

**The Americas show that large-scale economic coordination doesn't require money, markets, or the technologies we assume essential.**
