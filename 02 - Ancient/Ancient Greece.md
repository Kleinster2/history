# Ancient Greece

Ancient Greece was not a unified country but hundreds of independent city-states (poleis) sharing language, religion, and culture. This fragmented political landscape produced extraordinary innovation: democracy, philosophy, drama, history, and a competitive economic dynamism. Greek colonies spread from Spain to the Black Sea, creating the Mediterranean's first true commercial economy.
