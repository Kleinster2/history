# Bronze Age

The Bronze Age was humanity's first metal age—the period when copper-tin alloys enabled new weapons, tools, and social hierarchies. It witnessed the rise of the first empires, long-distance trade networks, and writing systems. The Bronze Age ended catastrophically around 1200 BCE in a collapse that destroyed nearly every major civilization in the Eastern Mediterranean.

## Overview

| Definition | Period when bronze was primary metal |
| Dates | ~3300-1200 BCE (varies by region) |
| Achievement | First empires, writing, cities |
| End | Bronze Age Collapse (~1200 BCE) |

| Late Bronze | 1550-1200 BCE | International age |

### Egypt

| Period | Dates | Characteristics |

## Bronze Technology

### The Alloy

| Component | Source |
|-----------|--------|
| Copper | Widespread |
| Tin | Rare (Cornwall, Afghanistan) |
| Ratio | ~90% copper, 10% tin |
| Result | Harder than copper |

### Why Bronze Mattered

| Advantage | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| Harder than copper | Better tools, weapons |
| Castable | Complex shapes |
| Reusable | Could be melted, recast |
| Status symbol | Expensive, elite goods |

### Economic Implications

| Effect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Trade necessity | Tin required long-distance exchange |
| Specialization | Bronze workers, miners |
| Elite control | Expensive technology |
| Warfare | Better weapons = more conquest |

## Late Bronze Age International System

### The Great Powers

| Power | Territory | Specialty |
|-------|-----------|-----------|
| Egypt | Nile, Canaan | Grain, gold |
| Hatti (Hittites) | Anatolia | Iron, military |
| Mitanni | N. Mesopotamia | Horses, chariots |
| Babylon | S. Mesopotamia | Trade, learning |
| Assyria | N. Mesopotamia | Military, trade |
| Mycenae | Greece | Ships, warriors |

### International Trade

| Good | Source | Destination |
|------|--------|-------------|
| Tin | Afghanistan, Cornwall | Everywhere |
| Copper | Cyprus | Everywhere |
| Gold | Egypt, Nubia | Everywhere |
| Lapis lazuli | Afghanistan | Egypt, Mesopotamia |
| Amber | Baltic | Mediterranean |

### The Amarna Letters

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Content | Diplomatic correspondence |
| Language | Akkadian (diplomatic lingua franca) |
| Date | ~1350-1330 BCE |
| Significance | Shows international system |

## [[Bronze Age Collapse]] (~1200 BCE)

### What Happened

| Event | Evidence |
|-------|----------|
| Destruction | ~50 major cities destroyed |
| Migrations | Sea Peoples, others |
| Systems failure | Trade networks collapsed |
| Writing lost | Linear B, others |
| Population decline | Significant |

### Theories

| Theory | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Sea Peoples | Invaders destroyed civilization |
| Climate | Drought, famine |
| Earthquakes | Seismic activity |
| Systems collapse | Interdependent networks failed together |
| Disease | Epidemic |
| Multiple causes | Combination |

### Who Survived

| Civilization | Outcome |
|--------------|---------|
| Egypt | Weakened but survived |
| Assyria | Survived, later expanded |
| Phoenicia | Emerged stronger |
| Greece | "Dark Age" (400 years) |

## Economic Significance

| Feature | Importance |
|---------|------------|
| First trade networks | Mediterranean-wide |
| Specialization | Economic complexity |
| Elite economy | Palatial redistribution |
| Collapse lesson | Systems can fail |
