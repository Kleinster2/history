# Africa

Africa—humanity's birthplace and second-largest continent—has a rich history often marginalized in world historical narratives. From ancient Egypt and Nubia to medieval Mali and Great Zimbabwe to early modern coastal trading states, Africa produced sophisticated civilizations and participated actively in global trade networks. Understanding African history counters Eurocentric biases and reveals continental contributions to world development.
