# Indus Valley Civilization

The Indus Valley (Harappan) Civilization was one of antiquity's great urban cultures—contemporary with Egypt and Mesopotamia but distinct in character. Spread across modern Pakistan and northwest India, it featured planned cities, standardized weights and measures, sophisticated drainage, and extensive trade networks. The civilization's peaceful character (no obvious fortifications or weapons) and undeciphered script make it enigmatic, but its economic sophistication is clear.
