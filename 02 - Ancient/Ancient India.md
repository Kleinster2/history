# Ancient India

Ancient India produced two distinct civilizations: the mysterious Indus Valley culture (2600-1900 BCE), with its planned cities and undeciphered script, and the later Vedic-Hindu civilization that gave rise to the Maurya and Gupta empires. India's position on the Indian Ocean made it a trade hub connecting East and West, exporting spices, textiles, and gems to Rome and China.
