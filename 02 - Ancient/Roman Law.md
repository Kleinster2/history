# Roman Law

Roman law is Rome's most enduring legacy—more lasting than its roads, aqueducts, or empire. The legal principles developed over a millennium became the foundation for most European legal systems, and through colonialism, spread worldwide. Roman law established concepts of property, contract, and legal procedure that still govern economic life today.
