# Assyrian Empire

The Neo-Assyrian Empire (911-609 BCE) was the ancient world's first true military superpower, conquering from Egypt to Iran through systematic warfare and terror. But Assyria was more than brute force: it created sophisticated administration, provincial organization, and information systems that later empires copied. The Assyrian economy combined agricultural tribute, commercial regulation, and war booty into an extraction machine that funded military dominance.
