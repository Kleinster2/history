# Darius I

Darius I (550-486 BCE), known as "the Great," transformed the Achaemenid Empire from a conquest state into an organized economic system. His administrative reforms—the satrap system, standardized coinage, tribute assessment, and the Royal Road—created the template for imperial governance that would influence empires for millennia.
