# New Kingdom Egypt

The New Kingdom (1550-1070 BCE) was ancient Egypt's imperial age—when pharaohs conquered an empire from Nubia to Syria, built the greatest monuments, and accumulated unprecedented wealth. This era produced Egypt's most famous rulers: [[Hatshepsut]], [[Thutmose III]], [[Akhenaten]], [[Tutankhamun]], [[Ramesses II]]. The New Kingdom demonstrates how military expansion generated wealth that funded temples, tombs, and the mortuary industry.
