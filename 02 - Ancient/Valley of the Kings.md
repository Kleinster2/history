# Valley of the Kings

The Valley of the Kings (Arabic: Wadi al-Muluk) is a royal necropolis on the west bank of the Nile at Thebes where pharaohs of the New Kingdom were buried for nearly 500 years. Containing 65 known tombs, this hidden valley replaced the highly visible pyramids in an attempt to protect royal burials from robbery—largely unsuccessfully. The valley provides crucial evidence for understanding New Kingdom royal ideology, material culture, and the economics of tomb construction.
