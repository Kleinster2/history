# Athens

Athens became the ancient world's most commercially sophisticated city—a paradox for a society whose philosophers condemned commerce. With Laurion's silver mines, the Piraeus port, and the owl tetradrachm, Athens built an economy that combined democracy, imperialism, and slavery into a system that dominated the eastern Mediterranean.
