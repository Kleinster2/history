# Abydos

Abydos was ancient Egypt's most sacred site—the burial place of Egypt's earliest kings and the cult center of Osiris, god of the dead. For three millennia, Egyptians made pilgrimage here, built cenotaphs, and sought burial near Osiris. The site reveals Egyptian religion, royal ideology, and the economics of death. Abydos shows how belief systems shaped resource allocation across Egyptian history.
