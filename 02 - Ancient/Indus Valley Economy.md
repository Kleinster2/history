# Indus Valley Economy

The Indus Valley Civilization presents one of the great puzzles of economic history: a sophisticated, standardized economy spanning over a million square kilometers—without visible kings, temples, or decipherable records. How did they coordinate?

## The Central Mystery

### What Other Bronze Age Economies Had

| Civilization | Economic Coordinators |
|--------------|----------------------|
| Mesopotamia | Temples, palaces, kings, written contracts |
| Egypt | Pharaoh, temples, bureaucracy, records |
| Indus Valley | ??? |

### What Indus Had Instead

| Feature | Evidence |
|---------|----------|
| Standardization | Same weights, bricks, planning everywhere |
| Trade | Long-distance, internal and external |
| Craft production | Specialized workshops |
| Urban infrastructure | Drainage, granaries, wells |
| Writing | Undeciphered, mostly on seals |

**No palaces. No royal tombs. No temples. No named rulers. Yet perfect standardization.**

## Standardization: The Economic Signature

### Weights

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Material | Chert, limestone, other stone |
| Shape | Cubical (most distinctive) |
| System | Binary below 8, then decimal |
| Base unit | ~0.85 grams |
| Range | Tiny (jewelry) to large (bulk goods) |
| Distribution | Identical across entire civilization |

**Standard Weight Sequence:**

| Ratio | Weight (approx) |
|-------|-----------------|
| 1 | 0.85 g |
| 2 | 1.7 g |
| 4 | 3.4 g |
| 8 | 6.8 g |
| 16 | 13.6 g |
| 32 | 27.2 g |
| 64 | 54.4 g |
| 160 | 136 g |
| 200 | 170 g |
| 320 | 272 g |
| 640 | 544 g |

### Bricks

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Ratio | 1:2:4 (thickness:width:length) |
| Standard size | 7 × 14 × 28 cm (common) |
| Variation | Minimal across sites |
| Distance | Same ratio 1,000+ km apart |

### City Planning

| Feature | Standardization |
|---------|-----------------|
| Grid layout | Orthogonal streets |
| Orientation | Often cardinal directions |
| Two-part city | Citadel + lower town |
| Street widths | Hierarchical (main, secondary) |
| Lot sizes | Relatively uniform |

### What This Implies

| Observation | Implication |
|-------------|-------------|
| No visible coercion | Voluntary compliance? |
| No central palace | Distributed authority? |
| Perfect uniformity | Strong coordination mechanism |
| Across 700 years | Persistent institutions |

## Trade

### Internal Trade

| Tiger | Present |
| "Proto-Shiva" | Famous but rare |

### Economic Function

| Use | Evidence |
|-----|----------|
| Sealing goods | Clay sealings found |
| Marking ownership | Personal/institutional marks |
| Trade authentication | Found at distant sites |
| Administrative tool | Standardized format |

### What Seals Tell Us

| Observation | Implication |
|-------------|-------------|
| Standardized format | Centralized production? |
| Wide distribution | Trade network extent |
| In Mesopotamia | Long-distance commerce |
| Many unicorn seals | Possible guild/group marker? |

## Craft Production

### Bead Making

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Materials | Carnelian, agate, lapis, steatite |
| Techniques | Drilling, etching, heating |
| Specialization | Workshop sites identified |
| Quality | Extremely high |
| Export | Found in Mesopotamia |

### Metallurgy

## Economic Organization: Theories

### Theory 1: Merchant Republics

| Argument | Evidence |
|----------|----------|
| Traders ruled | Seals suggest merchant identity |
| Collective governance | No single ruler visible |
| Trade focus | Economy seems commercial |
| Against | How enforce standards? |

### Theory 2: Corporate Groups

| Argument | Evidence |
|----------|----------|
| Guild-like organizations | Standardization by profession |
| Self-regulation | No visible state enforcement |
| Unicorn = guild mark? | Most common seal type |
| Against | Requires strong institutions |

### Theory 3: Heterarchy

| Argument | Evidence |
|----------|----------|
| Multiple power centers | No single capital |
| Distributed authority | Regional variation exists |
| Negotiated standards | Consensus-based |
| Against | Still need coordination mechanism |

### Theory 4: Invisible State

| Argument | Evidence |
|----------|----------|
| State existed | Standardization proves it |
| Different form | Not palace-based |
| Records lost | Perishable materials |
| Against | Why no archaeological trace? |

### Theory 5: Ideological Unity

| Argument | Evidence |
|----------|----------|
| Shared worldview | Uniform symbols, practices |
| Religious coordination | Great Bath ritual? |
| Voluntary compliance | Belief-based |
| Against | Still need enforcement |

## Comparison with Contemporaries

### Indus vs. Mesopotamia

| Feature | Indus | Mesopotamia |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| Visible rulers | None | Kings, records |
| Temples | None clear | Dominant |
| Palaces | None | Present |
| Inequality | Less visible | Very visible |
| Writing | Short, undeciphered | Long texts |
| Standardization | Extreme | Less uniform |
| Trade | Present | Present |

### Indus vs. Egypt

## The Decline

### Economic Indicators

| Period | Change |
|--------|--------|
| 2600-1900 BCE | Standardization maintained |
| 1900-1700 BCE | Standards break down |
| 1700-1300 BCE | Regional variation, smaller settlements |

### What Broke Down

| Feature | Before | After |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Weights | Uniform | Regional variation |
| Bricks | Standard ratio | Local sizes |
| Cities | Large, planned | Smaller, irregular |
| Trade | Long-distance | More local |
| Script | Used | Disappears |

### Possible Causes

| Factor | Evidence |
|--------|----------|
| Climate change | Monsoon shift |
| River changes | Ghaggar-Hakra dried |
| Trade disruption | Mesopotamian upheaval |
| System fragility | Over-reliance on coordination |

## What the Indus Teaches About Economy

### Lessons

| Observation | Implication |
|-------------|-------------|
| Standardization without kings | Markets/coordination can self-organize? |
| Trade without money | Weight-based systems work |
| Cities without temples | Economic ≠ religious coordination |
| Collapse of standards | Institutions are fragile |

### Questions for Economic History

| Question | Indus Evidence |
|----------|----------------|
| Do economies need states? | Maybe not (or different kind) |
| Do economies need money? | Weights worked |
| Do economies need religion? | Unclear what role religion played |
| What maintains standards? | Unknown mechanism |
