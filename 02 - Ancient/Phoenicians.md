# Phoenicians

The Phoenicians were the ancient Mediterranean's greatest traders and navigators—Semitic peoples from coastal Lebanon who spread commerce, colonies, and the alphabet across the sea. From their cities of Tyre, Sidon, and Byblos, they sailed to Spain, Africa, and possibly Britain, carrying goods and ideas. Their greatest legacy is the alphabet—the ancestor of Greek, Latin, Arabic, Hebrew, and all Western scripts.
