# Ptolemaic Egypt

Ptolemaic Egypt was the wealthiest and most stable of Alexander's successor kingdoms—ruled by the Ptolemaic dynasty from Alexandria for nearly three centuries. The Ptolemies combined Greek administration with Egyptian religious traditions, exploiting the Nile's agricultural wealth while making Alexandria the ancient world's greatest commercial and intellectual center. The dynasty ended with [[Cleopatra VII]]'s defeat and Rome's annexation.
