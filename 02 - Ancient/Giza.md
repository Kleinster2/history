# Giza

The Giza plateau, located on the outskirts of modern Cairo, is home to the most famous monuments of ancient Egypt: the three Great Pyramids, the Great Sphinx, and numerous associated temples and tombs. Built during the 4th Dynasty, this necropolis represents perhaps the largest construction project of the ancient world and provides crucial evidence for understanding the organization and economics of pharaonic Egypt.
