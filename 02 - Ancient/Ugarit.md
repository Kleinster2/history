# Ugarit

Ugarit was the Bronze Age's great trading city—a cosmopolitan port on the Syrian coast where ships from [[Cyprus]], [[New Kingdom Egypt|Egypt]], the [[Hittites|Hittite Empire]], and the Aegean converged. The city's archive of clay tablets documents international trade, diplomacy, and the invention of an early alphabet. Ugarit's destruction around 1185 BCE—and the desperate final letters found in its ruins—provides the most vivid evidence of the [[Bronze Age Collapse]]. The city was never rebuilt.
