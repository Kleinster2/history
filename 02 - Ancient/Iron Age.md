# Iron Age

The Iron Age began when the Bronze Age ended—when iron replaced bronze as the primary metal for tools and weapons. Iron ore is more abundant than copper and tin, making metal technology accessible to more societies. The Iron Age saw the rise of new empires (Assyria, Persia), new alphabets, new religions, and wider use of coinage. Iron democratized metal.

## Overview

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Definition | Iron as primary working metal |
| Dates | ~1200-500 BCE (varies by region) |
| Transition | From Bronze Age collapse |
| Significance | Widespread metal access |

## Iron vs. Bronze

### Advantages of Iron

| Advantage | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Abundance | Iron ore more common |
| No tin trade | Self-sufficient |
| Harder (when steeled) | Superior tools |
| Cheaper | Eventually |

### Disadvantages

| Disadvantage | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| Higher melting point | Harder to work |
| Rust | Corrodes |
| Early iron | Not as hard as bronze |
| Technology | Needed development |

## Origins

### Early Iron Working

| Region | Date | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|
| Anatolia (Hittites) | ~1400 BCE | Limited, prestige |
| Egypt | ~1350 BCE | Tutankhamun's dagger |
| Widespread | ~1200 BCE | After collapse |

### Why Then?

| Theory | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Collapse | Tin trade disrupted |
| Necessity | Bronze unavailable |
| Technology | Developed gradually |
| Competition | Arms race |

## Technology

### Iron Working

| Stage | Process |
|-------|---------|
| Smelting | Bloom (spongy mass) |
| Working | Hammering, reheating |
| Carburizing | Adding carbon (steel) |
| Quenching | Hardening |

### Steel Development

| Advance | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| Carburization | Harder metal |
| Quenching | Stronger edge |
| Control | Quality improvement |
| Full steel | Later development |

## Economic Effects

### Production Changes

| Change | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Local ore | No long-distance tin trade |
| More smiths | Widespread craft |
| Cheaper tools | More accessible |
| Agricultural | Better plows, axes |

### Agricultural Revolution

| Tool | Impact |
|------|--------|
| Iron plow | Heavier soils worked |
| Axes | Forest clearing |
| Sickles | Better harvest |
| Result | Production increase |

## Regional Development

### Near East

| Region | Character |
|--------|-----------|
| Anatolia | Early development |
| Assyria | Military use |
| Israel | Gradual adoption |
| Persia | Empire with iron |

### Mediterranean

| Region | Development |
|--------|-------------|
| Greece | After Dark Age |
| Italy | Etruscan, Roman |
| Phoenicia | Trade spread |

### Europe

| Region | Date |
|--------|------|
| Central Europe | Hallstatt culture (~800 BCE) |
| Northern Europe | Later |
| Britain | ~800 BCE |

### Africa

| Region | Development |
|--------|-------------|
| Nile Valley | From Egypt |
| Sub-Saharan | Independent development? |
| Meroe | Iron production center |

## Social Effects

### Military

| Change | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| More weapons | Larger armies |
| Better armor | Changed warfare |
| Cheaper | Wider distribution |

### Agriculture

| Change | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Better tools | More production |
| New lands | Forest cleared |
| Population | Growth enabled |

### Craft Production

| Change | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| More smiths | Local production |
| Specialization | Regional traditions |
| Trade | Iron goods moved |

## Political Changes

### New Empires

| Empire | Period |
|--------|--------|
| [[Assyria]] | 911-609 BCE |
| Neo-Babylonian | 626-539 BCE |
| [[Achaemenid Empire]] | 550-330 BCE |

### New States

| Development | Region |
|-------------|--------|
| Greek poleis | Greece |
| Phoenician cities | Levant |
| Israelite kingdoms | Canaan |
| Celtic states | Europe |
