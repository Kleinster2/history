# Silk Road

The Silk Road was not one road but a network of trade routes connecting China to the Mediterranean for over 1,500 years. Silk, spices, gems, and ideas flowed along caravan trails through Central Asia, transferring goods, technologies, religions, and diseases between civilizations. The name is modern (coined 1877), but the economic impact was ancient and profound.
