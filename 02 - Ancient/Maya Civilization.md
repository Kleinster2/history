# Maya Civilization

The Maya built one of the ancient world's most sophisticated civilizations—monumental cities, precise astronomy, complex writing, and long-distance trade networks—without metal tools, draft animals, or the wheel. Their economy ran on agriculture (maize), trade (obsidian, jade, cacao), and a currency system based on cacao beans. The Maya demonstrate that economic complexity doesn't require the Eurasian toolkit: they developed markets, specialized production, and trade networks independently. Their dramatic collapse (800-900 CE) also provides one of history's clearest cases of [[Economic Collapse|civilizational over-reach]].

## Overview

### Scale

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Territory | Southern Mexico, Guatemala, Belize, Honduras |
| Peak population | 10-15 million |
| Cities | 40+ major urban centers |
| Duration | 3,500+ years (with interruptions) |
| Writing | Only full writing system in pre-Columbian Americas |

### Timeline

| Period | Dates | Character |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| Preclassic | 2000 BCE - 250 CE | Agriculture, first cities |
| Classic | 250-900 CE | Peak civilization, great cities |
| Collapse | 800-1000 CE | Southern cities abandoned |
| Postclassic | 1000-1500 CE | Northern centers, trade focus |
| Spanish conquest | 1520s+ | Destruction of remaining states |

## The Maya Economy

### Agriculture

| Crop | Role |
|------|------|
| Maize | Staple (80% of calories) |
| Beans | Protein complement |
| Squash | Third of the triad |
| Cacao | Luxury, currency, ritual |
| Cotton | Textiles, tribute |

### Agricultural Innovation

| Technique | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| Raised fields | Wetland farming |
| Terracing | Hillside cultivation |
| Forest gardens | Managed agroforestry |
| Irrigation | Water management |
| Challenge | Thin tropical soils, variable rainfall |

## Trade Networks

### What Was Traded

| Good | Origin | Significance |
|------|--------|--------------|
| Obsidian | Guatemalan highlands | Tools, weapons (volcanic glass) |
| Jade | Motagua Valley | Status, ritual (more valued than gold) |
| Cacao | Pacific lowlands | Currency, drink, ritual |
| Salt | Coastal sources | Essential, controlled |
| Quetzal feathers | Highland forests | Royal regalia |
| Marine shells | Coast | Status goods |

### Trade Routes

| Route | Character |
|-------|-----------|
| Highland-lowland | Obsidian, jade down; cacao, cotton up |
| Coastal canoe routes | Caribbean, Pacific coasts |
| River systems | Inland transport |
| Overland paths | Porter-carried (no draft animals) |
| Scale | Goods moved 1,000+ km |

### Markets

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Market plazas | Archaeological evidence in major cities |
| Periodic markets | Regular trading days |
| Specialized merchants | Professional trader class |
| Long-distance trade | Elite-controlled luxury goods |
| Local exchange | Everyday goods, food |

## Cacao as Currency

### How It Worked

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Unit | Individual cacao beans |
| Value | Standardized (countable) |
| Demand | Universal desire (chocolate drink) |
| Durability | Dried beans last months |
| Divisibility | Single beans for small transactions |
| Counterfeiting | Filled empty shells with mud (documented) |

### Purchasing Power

| Item | Price (in cacao beans) |
|------|------------------------|
| Tomato | 1 bean |
| Rabbit | 10 beans |
| Slave | 100 beans |
| Turkey | 100-200 beans |
| Cotton mantle | 65-300 beans |

Cacao demonstrates that money doesn't require metal—any commodity that's desirable, portable, divisible, and durable can serve. Compare [[Greek Coinage]] (state-stamped metal) with Maya cacao (intrinsically valued commodity): different solutions to the same problem of facilitating exchange.

## Political Economy

### City-States

| Feature | Character |
|---------|-----------|
| Organization | Independent city-states (like Greece) |
| Ruler | K'uhul ajaw (divine lord) |
| Revenue | Tribute from subordinate towns |
| Labor | Corvée for construction, warfare |
| Competition | Constant warfare between cities |
| No empire | Never unified (unlike Aztec or Inca) |

### Tribute System

| Source | Payment |
|--------|---------|
| Subject towns | Cacao, cotton, labor, warriors |
| War captives | Sacrifice, labor |
| Elite control | Luxury goods redistributed |
| Commoners | Agricultural surplus, corvée |

## The Classic Collapse (800-1000 CE)

### What Happened

| Evidence | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Cities abandoned | Major centers (Tikal, Copán, Palenque) emptied |
| Construction stops | No new monuments after ~900 CE |
| Population crash | 90%+ decline in some areas |
| Warfare | Intensifies before collapse |
| Duration | ~150 years of decline |

### Proposed Causes

| Factor | Evidence |
|--------|----------|
| Drought | Lake sediment cores show dry periods |
| Deforestation | Pollen records show forest loss |
| Soil exhaustion | Intensive farming degraded land |
| Overpopulation | Carrying capacity exceeded |
| Warfare | Endemic conflict drained resources |
| Elite overreach | Monument-building consumed labor |
| Systems failure | Multiple causes reinforcing each other |

### The Economic Lesson

The Maya collapse shows how civilizations can grow beyond their ecological base. When agricultural surplus shrinks (drought + soil loss), the superstructure it supports (cities, kings, monuments, armies) becomes unsustainable. The elites responded by intensifying extraction (more war, more tribute)—which accelerated collapse. Compare [[Economic Collapse]] patterns in other civilizations.

## Legacy

### What the Maya Show

| Lesson | Implication |
|--------|-------------|
| Complexity without metals | Technology isn't destiny |
| Markets without coins | Cacao = commodity money |
| Trade without wheels | Human porters, canoes |
| Writing independently invented | Information technology universal need |
| Collapse from over-reach | Ecological limits are real |
| Recovery possible | Postclassic cities thrived differently |
