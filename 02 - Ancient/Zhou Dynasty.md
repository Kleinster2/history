# Zhou Dynasty

The Zhou dynasty (1046-256 BCE) was China's longest-ruling dynasty and witnessed the most profound economic transformation of ancient China—from bronze ritual economy to iron agriculture, from feudal tribute to market exchange, from cowrie shells to metal coinage. This was China's economic revolution.
