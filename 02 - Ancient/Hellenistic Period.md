# Hellenistic Period

The Hellenistic period began with Alexander's death and ended with Rome's conquest of Egypt. Alexander's generals divided his empire into kingdoms that fused Greek and Eastern cultures: the Ptolemies in Egypt, the Seleucids from Syria to Persia, the Antigonids in Macedonia. These kingdoms created a new economic world: larger markets, standardized coinage, long-distance trade, and the first truly international culture.
