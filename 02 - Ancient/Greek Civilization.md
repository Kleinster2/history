# Greek Civilization

Greek civilization—from the archaic period through the Hellenistic age—created cultural and intellectual foundations that shaped Western history. Beyond philosophy and democracy, Greeks developed commercial practices, coinage systems, and colonial networks that spread across the Mediterranean. Greek economic innovation included coined money, maritime commerce, and urban market economies that differed fundamentally from Near Eastern palace economies.
