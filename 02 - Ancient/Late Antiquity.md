# Late Antiquity

Late Antiquity marks the transition from the [[Classical]] Mediterranean world to the medieval period—roughly 300 to 500 CE in the West, longer in the East. The Roman economic system contracted: trade networks shrank, cities declined, currency debased, and the centralized state fragmented. But new institutions emerged, especially the Church, which would carry economic functions into the medieval world.
