# Ancient Credit & Debt

Debt is older than money. Before coins existed, Mesopotamian temples and merchants were lending grain at interest, recording debts on clay tablets, and creating the first financial crises. Ancient credit systems reveal that finance isn't a modern invention—it's a fundamental human technology for moving resources through time. The mechanisms developed in Sumer (interest, collateral, debt slavery, jubilee) created patterns that repeat through every subsequent financial system. Understanding ancient credit is understanding the origin of capitalism's most powerful—and dangerous—tool.

## Overview

### The Puzzle

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| What came first—money or debt? | Debt (by 2,000+ years) |
| Who invented interest? | Sumerian temples (~3000 BCE) |
| Why does debt exist? | Moves resources across time |
| Why is it dangerous? | Compounds, concentrates, enslaves |
| Why do societies tolerate it? | Enables investment, growth |

### Timeline

| Development | Date | Location |
|-------------|------|----------|
| Temple loans (grain) | ~3000 BCE | [[Sumer]] |
| Interest rates recorded | ~2400 BCE | Mesopotamia |
| [[Code of Hammurabi]] debt laws | ~1754 BCE | Babylon |
| Debt crises documented | ~2000 BCE+ | Mesopotamia |
| Royal debt cancellations | Periodic | Mesopotamia |
| Coinage enables lending | ~600 BCE | [[Greek Coinage|Lydia/Greece]] |
| Roman banking system | ~200 BCE+ | Rome |
| Christian usury ban | ~300 CE+ | Roman Empire |

## Mesopotamian Credit

### Temple Lending

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Lender | [[Temple Economy|Temple]] (institutional) |
| Borrower | Farmers, merchants |
| Security | Land, family members |
| Purpose | Seed grain, trade capital |
| Interest (grain) | 33% per year (standard) |
| Interest (silver) | 20% per year (standard) |
| Recording | Cuneiform on clay tablets |

### Why Temples Lent

| Reason | Logic |
|--------|-------|
| Surplus | Temples held grain stores |
| Investment | Lending increased production |
| Power | Debtors become dependents |
| Risk | Temple could absorb defaults |
| Revenue | Interest = income stream |

### Merchant Credit

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Trade credit | Advance goods, repay with profits |
| Partnership (tappûtum) | Share risk and returns |
| Long-distance | Credit enables distant trade |
| Bills | Clay tablets as transferable obligations |
| Networks | Merchant families across cities |

## The Debt Trap

### How Debt Enslaved

| Stage | Process |
|-------|---------|
| 1. Loan | Farmer borrows seed at 33% |
| 2. Bad harvest | Can't repay |
| 3. Compound | Debt grows each year |
| 4. Collateral | Loses land |
| 5. Family | Pledges wife, children as debt-slaves |
| 6. Permanent | Becomes dependent of creditor |
| Result | Debt concentration → social crisis |

### Debt Slavery

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Mechanism | Default → labor service |
| Duration | Until debt repaid (often never) |
| Scope | Family members included |
| Prevalence | Common across ancient world |
| Distinction | Not chattel slavery—still a person |
| Problem | Removes farmers from production |

## Royal Debt Cancellations

### The Clean Slate

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Sumerian | Amargi ("return to mother"—freedom) |
| Babylonian | Mīšarum (equity, justice) |
| Frequency | New king's accession, periodic crises |
| What cancelled | Consumer/agrarian debts |
| What preserved | Commercial debts (merchants' loans) |
| Purpose | Restore social balance, prevent revolt |

### Why Kings Cancelled Debts

| Reason | Logic |
|--------|-------|
| Military | Debt-slaves can't fight; free farmers can |
| Revenue | Indebted farmers can't pay taxes |
| Stability | Desperate debtors rebel |
| Legitimacy | "Justice" = royal duty |
| Reset | Prevent permanent oligarchy |

### The Biblical Jubilee

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Source | Leviticus 25 |
| Cycle | Every 50 years |
| Action | Debts cancelled, slaves freed, land returned |
| Origin | Mesopotamian clean slate tradition |
| Whether enforced | Debated |
| Significance | Debt cancellation as moral principle |

| Pasion | Famous banker (freed slave, richest Athenian) |
| Interest rates | 10-12% normal, 20-30% maritime |
| Innovation | Credit economy alongside coin economy |

### Maritime Loans (Bottomry)

| Letters of credit | Move money without moving coins |

## Attitudes Toward Interest

### The Ancient Debate

| Culture | View | Reasoning |
|---------|------|-----------|
| Mesopotamia | Accepted (regulated) | Natural, useful |
| [[Greek Economic Thought|Greek philosophy]] | Suspicious (Aristotle) | "Money breeding money" unnatural |
| Judaism | Banned between Jews | Community solidarity |
| Christianity | Banned (usury) | Aristotelian + biblical |
| Islam | Banned (riba) | Exploitation of need |
| Result | 1,500 years of interest prohibition (in theory) |

### Why Interest Was Banned

| Argument | Logic |
|----------|-------|
| Exploitation | Lender profits from borrower's desperation |
| Unproductive | Money doesn't "work"—only labor produces |
| Inequality | Interest concentrates wealth |
| Social damage | Debt destroys communities |
| Theological | Time belongs to God, not merchants |

### Why Interest Survived Anyway

| Mechanism | Where |
|-----------|-------|
| Fines for "late payment" | Christian Europe |
| Partnership (mudaraba) | Islamic world |
| Jewish lending to Christians | Medieval Europe |
| Rent charges | Various |
| Foreign exchange profits | Italian bankers |
| Result | [[Medieval Financial Innovation|Creative circumvention]] everywhere |

## Legacy

### What Ancient Credit Created

| Innovation | Modern Descendant |
|------------|-------------------|
| Interest | All lending |
| Collateral | Secured loans, mortgages |
| Debt slavery | Bankruptcy law (reformed) |
| Jubilee | Debt relief, sovereign default |
| Maritime loans | Insurance |
| Letters of credit | Banking, wire transfers |
| Compound interest | Every savings account |

### The Deeper Point

Ancient credit reveals finance's fundamental tension: it enables investment and growth (farmers need seed loans; merchants need trade capital) while simultaneously tending toward concentration and crisis (compound interest + bad luck = permanent debt). Every subsequent financial system—medieval, early modern, modern—struggles with the same tension. The Mesopotamian solution (periodic clean slates) and the philosophical solution (ban interest) both failed in different ways. Modern bankruptcy law and central banking are the latest attempts to manage what Sumerian scribes first documented 5,000 years ago.
