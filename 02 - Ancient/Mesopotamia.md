# Mesopotamia

Mesopotamia—"land between the rivers"—was the cradle of civilization. In the fertile valleys of the Tigris and Euphrates, humans first built cities, invented writing, created bureaucracies, and developed the institutions that would define complex societies. From Sumerian city-states to Babylonian empires, Mesopotamia pioneered economic innovations: standardized weights, contracts, interest-bearing loans, and legal codes. This region invented the organizational tools that made large-scale economic activity possible.
