# Amarna Period

The Amarna Period represents ancient Egypt's most radical rupture—when [[Akhenaten]] abandoned traditional gods for sole worship of the sun-disk Aten, moved the capital to a new city, and revolutionized art. This religious revolution disrupted temple economies, alienated the priesthood, and was rapidly reversed after Akhenaten's death. The period reveals how tightly religion, politics, and economics intertwined in ancient Egypt.
