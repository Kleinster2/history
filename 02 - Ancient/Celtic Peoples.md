# Celtic Peoples

The Celts were Iron Age peoples who dominated much of Europe from Iberia to Anatolia before Roman expansion. Defined by language family and material culture rather than political unity, Celtic societies were tribal, warrior-focused, and economically sophisticated. They built oppida (proto-cities), controlled trade routes, and produced remarkable metalwork. Roman conquest ended Celtic dominance on the continent, though Celtic cultures survived in Ireland, Scotland, Wales, and Brittany.
