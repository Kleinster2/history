# Babylonian Empire

Babylon—the great city on the Euphrates—twice dominated Mesopotamia: the Old Babylonian period of [[Hammurabi]] and the Neo-Babylonian Empire of Nebuchadnezzar. Babylon's contributions to civilization included legal codes, astronomical science, mathematics, and commercial practices. The city itself became a symbol of urban magnificence, its hanging gardens among the ancient wonders. Babylonian economic life featured sophisticated commerce, banking, and contract law.
