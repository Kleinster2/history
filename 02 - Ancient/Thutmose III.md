# Thutmose III

Thutmose III (reigned 1479-1425 BCE) was ancient Egypt's greatest warrior pharaoh—the "Napoleon of Egypt" who conducted 17 military campaigns and created an empire from Nubia to the Euphrates. His victory at Megiddo established Egyptian dominance in Syria-Palestine for a century. The wealth flowing from conquest and tribute transformed Egypt's economy, funding temples and supporting an expanded bureaucracy.
