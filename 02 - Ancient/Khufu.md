# Khufu

Khufu (Cheops in Greek) built the Great Pyramid of Giza—the largest single construction project in the ancient world and a monument to the organizational capacity of the Old Kingdom Egyptian state. From an economic perspective, the Great Pyramid is less interesting as a tomb than as a *project*: it required mobilizing 20,000+ workers for 20 years, feeding them, housing them, coordinating them, and managing supply chains for millions of stone blocks. This is the world's first mega-project—and it demonstrates that complex economic organization predates markets, money, and private enterprise. The Egyptian state could achieve things through command that no market economy would attempt for millennia.

## Overview

### The Great Pyramid

| Feature | Measure |
|---------|---------|
| Height | 146 meters (tallest structure for 3,800 years) |
| Base | 230 meters per side |
| Blocks | ~2.3 million (average 2.5 tons each) |
| Total mass | ~6 million tons |
| Construction period | ~20 years |
| Precision | Base level to within 2 cm |

## The Economics of Pyramid-Building

### Labor Force

| Feature | Evidence |
|---------|----------|
| Size | 20,000-30,000 workers (not 100,000 as Herodotus claimed) |
| Type | Free laborers, not slaves (archaeological proof) |
| Organization | Rotating crews (3-month shifts) |
| Skill levels | Core haulers, skilled masons, specialist craftsmen |
| Workers' village | [[Deir el-Medina]]-precursor discovered at Giza |
| Evidence | Graffiti naming crews ("Friends of Khufu," "Drunkards of Menkaure") |

### Feeding the Workers

| Supply | Scale |
|--------|-------|
| Bread and beer | Staple diet (thousands of loaves daily) |
| Meat | Cattle, sheep, goats—significant protein |
| Fish | Nile sources |
| Grain storage | Massive granaries at Giza |
| Logistics | Supply chain across Egypt |
| Implication | Required agricultural surplus of entire nation |

### Supply Chains

| Material | Source | Transport |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| Limestone (core) | Local quarries (Giza Plateau) | Rollers, ramps |
| Limestone (casing) | Tura (across Nile) | Boat |
| Granite | Aswan (800 km south) | Nile barges |
| Copper tools | Sinai mines | Overland + boat |
| Food | All Egypt | Nile, taxation |

## State Capacity

### What Pyramid-Building Required

| Capability | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| Taxation | Extract agricultural surplus nationwide |
| Census | Know who can work and when |
| Transport | Move millions of tons by Nile |
| Organization | Coordinate thousands simultaneously |
| Specialist knowledge | Surveying, engineering, astronomy |
| Record-keeping | Track materials, rations, workers |
| Authority | Compel participation (corvée labor) |

### The Command Economy Model

| Feature | Pyramid Economy |
|---------|-----------------|
| Planning | Central, pharaonic will |
| Allocation | State directs labor and materials |
| Incentive | Duty, religion, rations (not profit) |
| Coordination | Hierarchical bureaucracy |
| Duration | Sustained across decades |
| Scale | National resources for one project |

This is the first evidence of what the [[Soviet Economy]] would later attempt at industrial scale: a command economy directing resources toward state-chosen goals. The difference: Egypt's goals were religious-monumental; the USSR's were industrial-military. Both showed command can achieve scale—and both revealed the system's limits (rigidity, waste, no feedback).

## Economic Significance

### What the Pyramids Tell Us

| Lesson | Evidence |
|--------|----------|
| States precede markets | Complex economy without money |
| Surplus enables civilization | Nile agriculture funded everything |
| Organization is technology | Coordination as valuable as tools |
| Scale requires hierarchy | No large project without command |
| Labor ≠ slavery | Workers were fed, housed, honored |

### The Redistribution Economy

| How It Worked | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| Farmers produce surplus | Nile floods ensure harvest |
| State collects via tax | In-kind (grain, labor) |
| State redistributes | Rations to workers, offerings to gods |
| No money needed | Command + redistribution suffices |
| Limitation | Works for monuments, not innovation |

## Khufu's Legacy

### As Ruler

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Dynasty | 4th Dynasty, Old Kingdom |
| Capital | Memphis |
| Reign | ~23 years |
| Historical reputation | "Cruel" (Herodotus)—but no Egyptian evidence |
| Family | Son Khafre, grandson Menkaure built other Giza pyramids |
| Irony | Only surviving image is a 3-inch ivory statuette |

### As Economic Achievement

The Great Pyramid was the largest single investment of labor in human history until the Industrial Revolution. It represents the ultimate expression of what a command economy can achieve when it has surplus, authority, and purpose. No market economy would build a pyramid—there's no profit in it. But the organizational capabilities developed for pyramid-building (logistics, record-keeping, labor management, supply chains) are the *same* capabilities that later enabled states to build infrastructure, wage wars, and manage economies.
