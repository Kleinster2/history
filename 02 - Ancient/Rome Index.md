# Rome Index

Rome created the ancient world's largest integrated economy—a Mediterranean-wide system of trade, taxation, and production that wouldn't be matched in scale until the modern era. From the slave plantations of Sicily to the grain ships of Alexandria, from the silver mines of Spain to the silk arriving from China, Rome's economy connected three continents.

## The Roman Economic Achievement

|---------|-------|
| Territory | ~5 million km² at peak |
| Population | ~60-70 million |
| Currency | Denarius circulated from Britain to India |
| Roads | 80,000+ km of paved roads |
| Trade | Mediterranean as "Roman lake" |
| Duration | ~700 years of economic integration |
