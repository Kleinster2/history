# Sumerian Language

Sumerian was humanity's first written language—a linguistic isolate (related to no other known language) that served as the cultural and scholarly tongue of [[Mesopotamia]] for three millennia. Though Sumerian speakers were absorbed by Akkadian-speakers by 2000 BCE, the language survived in religious, literary, and scholarly contexts until the first century CE. Sumerian scribal schools preserved the language and trained administrators who managed ancient economies.
