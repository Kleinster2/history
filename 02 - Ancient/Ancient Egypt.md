# Ancient Egypt

Ancient Egypt was the Nile's gift—a civilization that endured three thousand years along a single river. The Nile's predictable floods created agricultural surplus that funded pyramids, temples, and one of history's most stable societies. Egypt's economy was redistributive: the state collected grain and allocated it to priests, officials, and workers. This system proved remarkably durable.
