# Cyrus the Great

Cyrus II of Persia founded the largest empire the world had yet seen—stretching from the Aegean to Central Asia. His conquests were remarkable not just for their scope but for their method: Cyrus practiced religious tolerance, respected local customs, and presented himself as a liberator rather than conqueror. The "Cyrus Cylinder" is sometimes called the first declaration of human rights.
