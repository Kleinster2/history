# Greek Economic Thought

The Greeks were the first to *think systematically* about economic life—but they were deeply ambivalent about it. Aristotle distinguished "natural" household management from "unnatural" money-making. Xenophon wrote the first treatise on estate management. Plato wanted to ban retail trade entirely. Greek thought gave us the word "economy" (oikonomia = household management) while simultaneously arguing that commerce was beneath the dignity of free citizens. This tension—between recognizing economic activity's importance and despising those who do it—echoed through Western thought for two millennia and shaped [[Institutions and Progress|which channels ambition could flow into]].

## Overview

### Key Thinkers

| Thinker | Dates | Contribution |
|---------|-------|--------------|
| Hesiod | ~700 BCE | Work ethic, scarcity, seasons |
| Xenophon | 430-354 BCE | Estate management, revenue |
| Plato | 428-348 BCE | Ideal state, division of labor, anti-commerce |
| Aristotle | 384-322 BCE | Natural vs. unnatural exchange, money |

### The Greek Paradox

| Reality | Ideology |
|---------|----------|
| [[Athens]] was a commercial powerhouse | Commerce was considered degrading |
| Markets were central to city life | Philosophers despised traders |
| [[Greek Coinage]] enabled prosperity | Money-making was "unnatural" |
| Trade made Greece rich | Ideal citizen was farmer or warrior |

## Hesiod: Scarcity and Work (~700 BCE)

### Works and Days

| Theme | Significance |
|-------|--------------|
| Scarcity | Resources are limited (Prometheus myth) |
| Work | Labor is necessary, not shameful |
| Seasons | Economic life follows natural rhythms |
| Justice | Fair dealing matters for prosperity |
| Competition | "Potter envies potter"—rivalry drives effort |

Hesiod is the first Western writer to treat economic life seriously—not as background, but as the central human problem: there isn't enough, so we must work.

## Xenophon: The First Economist? (370s BCE)

### Oeconomicus (Estate Management)

| Topic | Treatment |
|-------|-----------|
| Subject | How to run a household/estate |
| Ideal | Gentleman-farmer managing land, slaves, wife |
| Method | Rational organization, specialization |
| Innovation | First systematic treatment of management |
| Limitation | Only household, not market economy |

### Ways and Means (Poroi)

| Proposal | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| Attract metics (foreigners) | More commerce, more tax revenue |
| Develop Laurium mines | State revenue from silver |
| State-owned merchant ships | Public investment |
| Expand trade | Explicitly pro-commercial |
| Significance | First policy economics—how the state can increase revenue |

Xenophon is unusual: he actually *values* commerce and proposes policies to encourage it. Most Greek thinkers didn't.

## Plato: The Anti-Market (380s-350s BCE)

### Republic

| View | Reasoning |
|------|-----------|
| Division of labor | People differ in abilities (economic insight) |
| Specialization | Each should do what they're best at |
| But: fixed classes | Philosopher-kings, warriors, producers |
| No private property (for rulers) | Wealth corrupts judgment |
| Anti-trade | Commerce encourages greed |

### Laws

| Proposal | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| Ban retail for citizens | Trade degrades character |
| Fixed prices | Prevent speculation |
| Limited foreign trade | Avoid corruption |
| Agricultural ideal | Farming = virtuous |
| Money | Necessary evil, minimize its role |

### Plato's Influence

Plato's contempt for commerce influenced two millennia of Western thought—the idea that buying and selling is morally inferior to farming, fighting, or philosophizing. This attitude shaped [[Institutions and Progress|which activities societies honored]], channeling talent away from commerce in aristocratic cultures.

## Aristotle: The Framework (350s-330s BCE)

### Natural vs. Unnatural Exchange

| Type | Character | Judgment |
|------|-----------|----------|
| Oikonomike (household management) | Production for use | Natural, good |
| Kapelrike (retail trade) | Buying to sell at profit | Unnatural, suspect |
| Chrematistike (money-making) | Accumulation for its own sake | Worst—"unlimited" desire |

### On Money

| Observation | Significance |
|-------------|--------------|
| Money arose from barter inconvenience | First "origin of money" theory |
| Money is a convention (nomos) | Not natural, socially created |
| Money should facilitate exchange | Not be an end in itself |
| Usury is worst | "Money breeding money" is unnatural |
| Influence | Shaped Christian/Islamic ban on interest for 1,500 years |

### On Value

| Concept | Treatment |
|---------|-----------|
| Use value vs. exchange value | Shoes to wear vs. shoes to sell |
| Just price | Exchange should be "equal" |
| Proportional reciprocity | Each gives according to worth |
| Innovation | First to distinguish use/exchange value (later: Smith, Marx) |

### On Property

| View | Argument |
|------|----------|
| Private property | Natural—people care for their own |
| Against communism (vs. Plato) | Common property = neglect |
| But: moderation | Excess wealth corrupts |
| Distribution | Middle class = stable polity |

## The Status of Commerce

### Why Greeks Despised Trade

| Reason | Logic |
|--------|-------|
| Citizen = warrior/politician | Commerce is servile |
| Self-sufficiency ideal | Needing others = dependence |
| Agriculture = virtuous | Contact with land ennobles |
| Trade = deception | Buying cheap, selling dear |
| Metics and slaves trade | Low-status people do it |
| Leisure required | Citizenship needs free time, not labor |

### But Reality Was Different

| Evidence | Implication |
|----------|-------------|
| Athenian commerce boomed | People traded regardless of ideology |
| Citizens did trade | Despite philosophical disapproval |
| Courts enforced contracts | Legal infrastructure for commerce |
| Banking existed | Pasion (freed slave) became richest Athenian |
| Navy protected trade | State invested in commercial infrastructure |

### The Gap Between Theory and Practice

Greek philosophers wrote for aristocrats and aspiring aristocrats. Their anti-commercial ideology reflected *elite* values, not economic reality. Athens was a thriving commercial city whose citizens, metics, and slaves all participated in markets—even as philosophers insisted this was beneath them. The ideology mattered not because people obeyed it, but because it shaped what was *honored*: the channels through which ambitious people sought status.

## Legacy

### What Survived

| Greek Idea | Later History |
|------------|---------------|
| Usury is unnatural | Christian/Islamic interest bans |
| Commerce is degrading | Aristocratic contempt for "trade" |
| Just price | Medieval scholastic economics |
| Use vs. exchange value | Smith, Ricardo, Marx |
| Division of labor | Smith's pin factory |
| Money as convention | Modern monetary theory |
| Anti-commercial virtue | Republican ideology (Rome, Renaissance) |

### What Was Missing

| Concept | Greeks Lacked |
|---------|---------------|
| Supply and demand | No price theory |
| Growth | No concept of economic progress |
| Comparative advantage | Trade as zero-sum |
| Innovation value | Technology = for slaves |
| Market equilibrium | No self-regulating system idea |

### The Deeper Point

Greek economic thought matters not for its analytical power (limited) but for its *moral framework*: the idea that making money is suspect, that commerce corrupts, that the good life requires distance from markets. This framework, transmitted through Rome, Christianity, and Islam, shaped which societies honored commerce and which didn't—and therefore which developed market economies and which didn't. When [[Entrepreneurship|Baumol asks]] why some societies channel talent into production and others don't, Greek philosophy is part of the answer.
