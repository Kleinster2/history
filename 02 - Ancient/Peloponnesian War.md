# Peloponnesian War

The Peloponnesian War (431-404 BCE) was ancient Greece's great civil conflict—pitting [[Athens]] and its maritime empire against [[Sparta]] and its land-based allies. The war transformed Greek politics and economics: Athens lost its empire, Sparta gained temporary hegemony, and the entire Greek world was weakened. The conflict shows how war exhausts economies and how commercial power (Athens) can lose to military persistence (Sparta).
