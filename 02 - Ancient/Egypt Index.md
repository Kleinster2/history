# Ancient Egypt

Ancient Egypt was one of history's longest-lasting and most influential civilizations, enduring for over 3,000 years along the Nile River. From the unification under Narmer around 3100 BCE to Cleopatra's death in 30 BCE, Egypt produced iconic monuments, a sophisticated writing system, complex religious beliefs, and a remarkably stable culture that fascinated the ancient world and continues to captivate us today.
