# Assyria

Assyria was a major Mesopotamian civilization centered in northern Iraq. Beginning as a city-state, it grew into one of the ancient world's most powerful and feared empires. The Neo-Assyrian Empire (911-609 BCE) was the first true "world empire," conquering from Egypt to Iran and pioneering administrative and military techniques used by all subsequent Near Eastern empires.
