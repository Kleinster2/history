# Human History Vault

An economic history of everything—how humanity went from subsistence to modernity.

---

## The Central Question

**How did we get here?** From hunter-gatherers to industrial civilization, from local subsistence to global markets, from muscle power to machines. Every note in this vault, whether about Cistercian monks or Cold War missiles, asks: what does this tell us about material progress?

### The Main Narrative (chronological)

| Period | Start Here | The Economic Story |
|--------|-----------|-------------------|
| [[01 - Prehistory/Prehistory Index\|Prehistory]] | [[Origins of Economy]] | Cooperation, trade, specialization emerge |
| [[02 - Ancient/Ancient Index\|Ancient]] | [[Ancient Index]] | States, money, property, markets invented |
| [[03 - Medieval/Medieval Index\|Medieval]] | [[Medieval Index]] | Commercial revival, financial innovation |
| [[04 - Early Modern/Early Modern Index\|Early Modern]] | [[Industrial Revolution]] | The great divergence, industrialization |
| [[05 - Modern/Modern Index\|Modern]] | [[Modern Index]] | Global capitalism, alternatives, crises |

### Key Turning Points

Follow these for the story of how growth became self-sustaining:

1. [[Neolithic Revolution]] — Agriculture enables surplus, hierarchy, specialization
2. [[Ancient Credit]] — Finance predates coinage; debt enables trade
3. [[Medieval Financial Innovation]] — Bills of exchange, double-entry, banking
4. [[Guild Economics]] — Craft organizations: protection or barrier?
5. [[Industrial Revolution]] — Why Britain, why then, why sustained
6. [[Mass Production]] — Ford, Toyota, and the factory as social system
7. [[Globalization]] — Three waves of integration and backlash

### The "Why" Questions

| Question | Notes |
|----------|-------|
| Why did growth happen *there*? | [[Great Divergence]], [[Institutions and Progress]] |
| Why do some countries stay poor? | [[Development Economics]], [[Decolonization]] |
| What makes growth reverse? | [[Financial Crises]], [[Economic Collapse]] |
| What persists across all systems? | [[Economic Persistence]], [[Property Rights]] |
| What drives innovation? | [[Innovation Economics]], [[Steam Engine]] |

### Alternative Systems

The vault isn't just about capitalism. Compare:

- [[Soviet Economy]] — Command economy: achievements and failures
- [[Asian Tigers]] — State-directed development
- [[Islamic Economy]] — Medieval alternative commercial system

| [[Innovation Economics]] | Why is sustained innovation rare? |
| [[Property Rights]] | How does ownership structure affect investment? |

## The Vault's Thesis

Sustained economic growth requires institutions that channel human ambition into *production* rather than *extraction*—secure property rights, competitive markets, rule of law, open entry. This isn't a moral claim; it's the pattern that emerges from comparing civilizations across 10,000 years. Song China, Abbasid Baghdad, Renaissance Florence, Industrial Britain: all combined these elements temporarily. The question is why some societies sustained them and others didn't. See [[Institutions and Progress]] for the full argument.
