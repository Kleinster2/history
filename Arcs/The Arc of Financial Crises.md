# The Arc of Financial Crises

Financial crises are not aberrations—they're features of capitalism. From the [[South Sea Bubble]] (1720) to the [[2008 Financial Crisis Deep Dive|2008 collapse]], the same pattern recurs: innovation, euphoria, overextension, panic, crash. This arc traces how financial crises evolved, what they reveal about markets and human nature, and why—despite centuries of experience—we keep repeating the pattern.

## Prologue: Why Crises Recur

### The Minsky Cycle

Economist Hyman Minsky explained the paradox: **stability breeds instability**.

| Phase | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| After a crisis | Everyone's cautious |
| Stability returns | Confidence grows |
| Confidence grows | Risk-taking increases |
| Risk-taking increases | Leverage builds |
| Leverage builds | System becomes fragile |
| Small shock | Triggers collapse |
| Collapse | Everyone's cautious again |

The cycle is endogenous—capitalism generates its own crises through the same processes that generate growth.

### The Human Constants

| Bias | Role in Crises |
|------|----------------|
| Greed | "I'll get in early, get out before crash" |
| FOMO | "Everyone's making money but me" |
| Herding | "Smart people are doing it" |
| Recency | "Recent gains predict future" |
| "This time is different" | "New technology changes everything" |

These don't change. The assets change (tulips, railways, dotcoms, crypto), but human psychology is constant.

## Act I: The Early Bubbles (1600-1800)

### Tulip Mania (1637)

The first well-documented bubble:

| Feature | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| Asset | Tulip bulbs (rare varieties) |
| Peak | Single bulb = Amsterdam house price |
| Mechanism | Futures contracts, speculation |
| Crash | February 1637, sudden collapse |
| Debate | How widespread was it really? |

Recent scholarship suggests tulip mania was narrower than legend—mostly professional traders, limited broader damage. But it established the template: new asset, rapid price rise, spectacular crash.

### South Sea Bubble (1720)

The first modern financial crisis:

| Feature | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| Asset | South Sea Company stock |
| Promise | Trade monopoly with Spanish America |
| Reality | Mostly a debt conversion scheme |
| Peak | Stock up 10x in months |
| Crash | 80% decline |
| Famous victim | Isaac Newton: "I can calculate the motions of heavenly bodies, but not the madness of people" |

The South Sea Bubble was government-enabled: the company took on national debt in exchange for its monopoly. When the bubble burst, Parliament investigated, directors were punished, and the Bubble Act (1720) restricted joint-stock companies for a century.

**Lesson learned**: Restrict speculation.
**Lesson forgotten**: Within years, similar schemes appeared elsewhere.

### Mississippi Bubble (1720)

Same year, same pattern, different country:

| Feature | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| Location | France |
| Architect | John Law |
| Vehicle | Mississippi Company + French central bank |
| Innovation | Paper money backed by colonial prospects |
| Collapse | Hyperinflation, Law fled |
| Legacy | French distrust of paper money for generations |

---

## Act II: The Age of Panics (1800-1930)

### Crises Become Regular

The 19th century saw financial crises roughly every 10-20 years:

| Year | Crisis | Trigger |
|------|--------|---------|
| 1825 | British panic | Latin American bonds |
| 1837 | US/UK panic | Land speculation, cotton |
| 1857 | Global panic | Railroad overbuilding |
| 1866 | Overend-Gurney | British bank failure |
| 1873 | Long Depression | Railroad bubble bursts |
| 1893 | US panic | Silver, railroads |
| 1907 | Bankers' Panic | Trust companies |

### The Pattern Solidifies

Kindleberger's model emerged from these crises:

| Phase | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Displacement | New opportunity (technology, territory) |
| Boom | Credit expands, prices rise |
| Euphoria | "New era" thinking |
| Profit-taking | Smart money exits |
| Panic | Crash, credit contraction |
| Revulsion | Overcorrection |

Each crisis followed this template. Each time, observers said "never again." Each time, it happened again.

### 1907: The Turning Point

The Panic of 1907 was different—not in cause but in response:

| Feature | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| Trigger | Trust company failures |
| Savior | J.P. Morgan personally organized rescue |
| Problem | One man shouldn't control financial system |
| Response | Federal Reserve created (1913) |

**Institutional innovation**: A central bank to act as lender of last resort. Surely this would prevent future panics?

## Act III: The Great Crash (1929)

### The Roaring Twenties

The 1920s had all the ingredients:

| Factor | Role |
|--------|------|
| New technology | Radio, automobiles, electricity |
| Credit expansion | Margin buying for stocks |
| Optimism | "New era" of permanent prosperity |
| Leverage | Buying stocks with 10% down |

### The Crash

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| September 1929 | Market peaks |
| October 24 | "Black Thursday" |
| October 29 | "Black Tuesday"—market collapses |
| By 1932 | Down 89% from peak |

### From Crash to Depression

The crash alone didn't cause the [[Great Depression]]—policy failures did:

| Policy Failure | Effect |
|----------------|--------|
| Fed tightened | Deflation, credit contraction |
| Smoot-Hawley tariff | Trade collapsed |
| Bank failures | 9,000+ banks failed (1930-33) |
| No deposit insurance | Bank runs rational |
| Gold standard | Constrained response |

**Lesson**: The crash is the trigger; policy determines severity.

### The New Deal Response

The 1930s created modern financial regulation:

| Innovation | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| FDIC (1933) | Deposit insurance—stop bank runs |
| SEC (1934) | Securities regulation—prevent fraud |
| Glass-Steagall (1933) | Separate commercial and investment banking |
| Social Security (1935) | Automatic stabilizers |

For 50 years, these institutions seemed to work. Major banking crises disappeared from developed countries.

## Act IV: Crisis Returns (1970-2000)

### The Quiet Period Ends

From the 1940s-1970s, financial crises were rare in developed countries. Then they returned:

| Crisis | Year | Location |
|--------|------|----------|
| Penn Central | 1970 | US |
| Herstatt Bank | 1974 | Germany |
| S&L Crisis | 1980s | US |
| LDC Debt Crisis | 1982 | Latin America |
| Stock crash | 1987 | Global |
| Japan bubble | 1989 | Japan |
| ERM Crisis | 1992 | Europe |
| Tequila Crisis | 1994 | Mexico |
| Asian Crisis | 1997 | East Asia |
| LTCM | 1998 | US |
| Dot-com | 2000 | Global |

### What Changed?

| Development | Effect |
|-------------|--------|
| Financial deregulation | More risk-taking allowed |
| Financial innovation | New instruments, new risks |
| Globalization | Crises spread faster |
| Capital mobility | Hot money could flee |
| Leverage | New ways to amplify |

### The Asian Financial Crisis (1997)

A template for modern crises:

| Phase | Development |
|-------|-------------|
| Boom | Hot money flowed to "Asian tigers" |
| Fixed rates | Currencies pegged to dollar |
| Overinvestment | Real estate, capacity |
| Trigger | Thailand devalued (July 1997) |
| Contagion | Spread to Korea, Indonesia, Malaysia |
| IMF | Controversial austerity programs |

**Lesson**: Capital mobility + fixed exchange rates + weak banks = crisis waiting to happen.

---

## Act V: The Big One (2008)

### The Setup

The 2000s created perfect conditions:

| Factor | Role |
|--------|------|
| Low interest rates | Cheap money after dot-com crash |
| Housing ideology | "Ownership society" |
| Securitization | Banks could sell mortgages, ignore quality |
| Rating agencies | Blessed garbage as AAA |
| Leverage | 30:1 at investment banks |
| Shadow banking | Unregulated, fragile |
| Complexity | No one understood the system |

### The Subprime Machine

| Step | Process |
|------|---------|
| Originate | Bank makes risky mortgage |
| Securitize | Bundle mortgages into MBS |
| Tranche | Slice into AAA/BBB/equity |
| Rate | Agencies bless senior tranches |
| Sell | Pension funds, banks buy "safe" AAA |
| Repeat | Everyone's making money |

The problem: if housing prices fell, the whole edifice collapsed.

### The Crisis

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| 2006 | Housing prices peak |
| Feb 2007 | HSBC warns on subprime |
| Aug 2007 | BNP Paribas freezes funds |
| Mar 2008 | Bear Stearns rescued |
| Sep 7, 2008 | Fannie/Freddie seized |
| Sep 15, 2008 | Lehman Brothers bankrupt |
| Sep 16, 2008 | AIG rescued ($85B) |
| Sep-Oct 2008 | Global panic |

### Why Lehman Mattered

Lehman's bankruptcy broke the assumption that major institutions would be saved:

| Effect | Consequence |
|--------|-------------|
| Counterparty fear | No one trusted anyone |
| Money markets froze | Commercial paper market died |
| Credit stopped | Even healthy firms couldn't borrow |
| Global contagion | Every connected bank affected |

### The Response

Unlike 1929-33, authorities acted aggressively:

| Action | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Fed: Zero rates | Cheap money |
| Fed: QE | Bought $4T+ in assets |
| TARP | $700B bank bailout |
| FDIC guarantees | Prevented bank runs |
| Global coordination | Central banks acted together |

The result: deep recession, but not depression.

### Aftermath

| Reform | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| Dodd-Frank | Financial regulation overhaul |
| Higher capital requirements | Banks hold more equity |
| Stress tests | Check resilience |
| Living wills | Plans for orderly failure |
| Consumer protection | CFPB created |

**The question**: Are we safer, or just waiting for the next one?

## The Pattern Across Three Centuries

### What Stays the Same

| Constant | Evidence |
|----------|----------|
| Human psychology | Greed, fear, herding unchanged |
| Credit cycles | Expansion → excess → contraction |
| "This time is different" | Every bubble, every time |
| Complexity obscures | New instruments, same risks |
| Regulators lag | Always fighting last war |

### What Changes

| Variable | Evolution |
|----------|-----------|
| Scale | Local → national → global |
| Speed | Months → days → hours |
| Instruments | Stocks → derivatives → synthetic CDOs |
| Interconnection | Local banks → global networks |
| Policy response | Nothing → lender of last resort → massive intervention |

### The Institutional Learning

| Era | Key Institution |
|-----|-----------------|
| Pre-1913 | None (J.P. Morgan) |
| 1913-1930s | Federal Reserve (failed) |
| 1930s-1980s | New Deal framework (worked) |
| 1980s-2008 | Deregulation (failed) |
| 2008-present | Post-crisis framework (TBD) |

---

## Why We Don't Learn

### Memory Fades

| Generation | Experience |
|------------|------------|
| Depression survivors | Ultra-cautious |
| Their children | Cautious |
| Grandchildren | "History, not experience" |
| Great-grandchildren | "Different world" |

By the time those who remember are gone, the lessons are too.

### Incentives Misalign

| Actor | Incentive |
|-------|-----------|
| Bankers | Upside is mine, downside is yours |
| Regulators | Don't rock the boat |
| Politicians | Boom is good for elections |
| Voters | Cheap credit feels good |
| Rating agencies | Paid by issuers |

Everyone profits from the boom; costs are socialized in the bust.

### Complexity Enables

Each generation of finance invents new complexity that regulators don't understand:
- 1920s: Margin buying
- 1980s: Junk bonds
- 2000s: Structured products
- 2020s: Crypto, DeFi?

By the time regulators catch up, the crisis has happened.

## The Honest Conclusion

Financial crises will continue. The mechanisms that generate growth—credit, risk-taking, innovation—are the same mechanisms that generate crises. We can make crises less frequent and less severe through institutions (deposit insurance, capital requirements, central banks). We cannot eliminate them.

The [[Ponzi Schemes|frauds]] we documented ([[Charles Ponzi]], [[Bernie Madoff]]) are extreme cases, but they exist on a spectrum with "legitimate" speculation. The difference between a Ponzi scheme and a speculative bubble is intent and disclosure—but from the victim's perspective, the experience is similar.

The best we can do:
1. Remember that "this time" is never different
2. Build institutions that limit damage when crises occur
3. Ensure costs fall on those who profited from risks
4. Maintain the humility to know we'll be fooled again
