# How Europe Overtook China

For most of recorded history, China was the world's largest, most sophisticated economy. In 1000 CE, [[Song China Economy|Song China]] had gunpowder, printing, paper money, a canal system, and proto-industrial production. Europe was a backwater. By 1900, the positions had reversed: Europe and its offshoots dominated the globe, while China had collapsed into poverty and humiliation. What happened?

This is the story of the [[Great Divergence]]—perhaps the most consequential economic shift in human history.

## Prologue: China's Early Lead

### Song Dynasty Peak (960-1279)

Around 1000 CE, Song China was centuries ahead:

| Innovation | Date | Europe Equivalent |
|------------|------|-------------------|
| Gunpowder weapons | 10th c. | 14th c. |
| Printing (movable type) | 11th c. | 15th c. |
| Paper money | 10th c. | 17th c. |
| Blast furnaces | 11th c. | 18th c. |
| Compass navigation | 11th c. | 13th c. |

Iron production in Song China reached levels England wouldn't match until 1700. The population exceeded 100 million. Commercial agriculture, urban markets, and long-distance trade flourished.

### Why Didn't China Industrialize First?

This is the puzzle. China had:
- Technology (sometimes superior)
- Markets (larger than Europe's)
- Capital (wealthy merchants)
- Labor (abundant population)

Yet the Industrial Revolution happened in Britain, not Jiangnan. The arc of divergence requires explaining not just European rise but Chinese stagnation.

## Act I: The Medieval Equilibrium (1000-1500)

### Two Worlds, Roughly Equal

In this period, Europe and China were different but comparable:

| Dimension | China | Europe |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| Political | Unified empire | Fragmented states |
| Economy | Agricultural + commercial | Agricultural + commercial |
| Technology | Slightly ahead | Catching up |
| Living standards | Roughly similar | Roughly similar |

Recent scholarship ([[Kenneth Pomeranz]], [[Bin Wong]]) argues that as late as 1750, the Yangzi Delta and England had similar living standards. The divergence wasn't ancient—it was recent and rapid.

### Europe's Peculiar Fragmentation

What Europe lacked in unity, it gained in competition:

| Fragmentation Effect | Consequence |
|---------------------|-------------|
| No universal empire | No one could suppress innovation |
| State competition | Rulers courted merchants, talent |
| Exit options | Unhappy with one king? Move. |
| War pressure | Forced fiscal/military innovation |

China's unity was a strength—until it wasn't. A single decision (like the [[Ming Dynasty Economy|Ming]] maritime bans) could affect the entire civilization. In Europe, if one state banned something, another welcomed it.

## Act II: The Paths Diverge (1500-1750)

### Europe's Atlantic Breakthrough

The [[Age of Exploration]] changed everything:

| Development | Impact |
|-------------|--------|
| Americas discovered | New land, labor, resources |
| Atlantic trade | Sugar, silver, slaves |
| Colonial extraction | Wealth flowed to Europe |
| New crops | Potatoes, maize improved nutrition |

China had explored (Zheng He, 1405-1433) but turned inward. Europe explored and exploited. The difference wasn't capability—it was institutional incentives.

### Why China Turned Inward

| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Zheng He's voyages | Impressive but expensive |
| Confucian ideology | Merchants low-status |
| Mongol/nomad threat | Resources went north |
| Sufficient domestic economy | Less need for external trade |
| Single decision-maker | Emperor could end exploration |

The Ming banned private maritime trade (1371-1567, intermittently). When the ban lifted, the moment had passed. European powers controlled the sea lanes.

### The "Industrious Revolution" in Both Places

Both Europe and China experienced intensification of labor:

| Region | Development |
|--------|-------------|
| Europe | More work hours, proto-industry |
| China | More intensive farming, handicrafts |

But they diverged in *direction*:
- Europe: Labor-saving, capital-using
- China: Labor-using, land-saving

Why? Land was scarce in both places. But European wages were higher (due to Black Death population loss), making labor-saving machinery worthwhile. Chinese wages were lower, making labor-intensive methods rational.

## Act III: The Industrial Revolution (1750-1850)

### Why Britain?

The [[Industrial Revolution]] began in Britain, not China, for reasons that were contingent but consequential:

| Factor | Britain | China |
|--------|---------|-------|
| Coal | Abundant, accessible, near industry | Abundant but far from commercial centers |
| Wages | High (worth replacing with machines) | Low (labor cheaper than machines) |
| Colonies | Provided markets, raw materials | Self-sufficient (less external push) |
| Institutions | Patent system, property rights | State could confiscate |
| Competition | Rival states drove innovation | Single empire, less pressure |

### The Coal Accident

Robert Allen's argument: British coal was cheap and British labor expensive. This specific price ratio made steam engines economical. In China, the coal deposits were in the north (Shanxi), far from the commercial centers in the south (Yangzi Delta). Transporting coal was prohibitively expensive.

| Location | Coal Access |
|----------|-------------|
| Manchester | Coal mines nearby |
| Birmingham | Coal mines nearby |
| Jiangnan | 1,000+ km from coal |

This wasn't Chinese "failure"—it was geographic bad luck.

### Institutions and Incentives

But geography isn't destiny. European institutions also mattered:

| Institution | Effect |
|-------------|--------|
| Patent system | Inventors captured returns |
| Property rights | Investment was secure |
| Corporate forms | Could pool capital |
| Scientific societies | Shared knowledge |
| State competition | Rulers rewarded innovators |

In China, successful merchants faced different incentives:

| Reality | Response |
|---------|----------|
| State could confiscate | Buy land, official titles |
| Sons should take exams | Invest in education, not enterprise |
| Merchant status low | Hide wealth, don't expand visibly |

The rational Chinese merchant converted commercial wealth into land and gentry status. The rational British merchant reinvested in the business.

## Act IV: The Gap Widens (1850-1950)

### Industrialization Spreads—In Europe

The Industrial Revolution spread from Britain to:
- Belgium (1820s)
- France (1830s)
- Germany (1840s)
- United States (1840s)

But not to China. Why?

| Barrier | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| Opium Wars (1839-42, 1856-60) | Humiliation, unequal treaties |
| Taiping Rebellion (1850-64) | 20-30 million dead |
| [[Qing China Economy\|Qing]] dysfunction | State couldn't reform |
| Treaty ports | Foreign enclaves drained wealth |

China wasn't just stagnating—it was actively exploited. The "century of humiliation" reversed a millennium of leadership.

### The Numbers

| Year | China % of World GDP | Europe % of World GDP |
|------|---------------------|----------------------|
| 1000 | ~25% | ~10% |
| 1500 | ~25% | ~18% |
| 1820 | ~33% | ~27% |
| 1900 | ~11% | ~40% |
| 1950 | ~5% | ~30% |

The divergence accelerated precisely when industrialization took off.

## Act V: Reversal? (1978-Present)

### China Rises Again

After 1978, [[Deng Xiaoping]]'s reforms unleashed growth:

| Metric | 1978 | 2020 |
|--------|------|------|
| GDP (nominal) | $150B | $14T+ |
| Share of world GDP | ~2% | ~18% |
| Manufacturing | Minor | World's largest |
| Poverty rate | 88% | <1% |

### The Great Convergence?

Is the divergence reversing?

| Argument For | Argument Against |
|--------------|------------------|
| China catching up fast | Still below in per capita terms |
| Manufacturing dominance | Innovation still Western-led |
| Scale advantages | Political system limits? |
| Historical "return to normal" | Or new normal? |

---

## What the Arc Shows

### Contingency, Not Destiny

The divergence wasn't inevitable:
- China had the technology
- Europe got lucky (coal location, Atlantic access)
- Institutions amplified small advantages
- Critical junctures mattered (Ming maritime bans, British patent system)

### Institutions as Amplifiers

Both geography and institutions mattered, but institutions determined whether advantages were exploited:

| Factor | Without Institutions | With Institutions |
|--------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Coal | Just a rock | Industrial fuel |
| Atlantic | Just an ocean | Colonial wealth pump |
| Ideas | Curiosities | Applied innovation |

### The Role of Contingency

| Contingent Event | Consequence |
|------------------|-------------|
| Black Death | High European wages |
| Ming maritime bans | China missed Atlantic |
| British coal location | Steam made sense |
| Qing collapse | Century of humiliation |

### Lessons

1. **Early leads don't guarantee victory**: Song China's innovations didn't produce industrialization
2. **Institutions shape whether advantages matter**: Britain's coal mattered because institutions encouraged using it
3. **Fragmentation has benefits**: European competition drove innovation that Chinese unity couldn't
4. **Geography is not destiny**: But it sets the playing field
5. **Reversals are possible**: China's recent rise shows divergence isn't permanent

## The Deepest Question

Why did sustained modern economic growth—the escape from the Malthusian trap—emerge in Europe rather than China?

The honest answer: we don't fully know. The factors were multiple, interacting, and partly contingent. Coal. Colonies. Competition. Institutions. Ideas. All mattered. None was sufficient alone.

What we do know: by 1900, a civilization that had led for millennia was prostrate, and a civilization that had been peripheral was dominant. That reversal shaped the modern world—and its ongoing re-reversal may shape the next century.
