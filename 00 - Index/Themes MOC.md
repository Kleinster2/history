## How to Use Themes

Themes connect the vault across periods. Use them to:
- Compare how different civilizations approached the same economic challenge
- Trace institutions evolving over millennia (e.g., [[Ancient Credit]] → [[Medieval Financial Innovation]] → [[Financial Crises|modern finance]])
- Understand why some patterns persist while others transform
- See the [[Institutions and Progress|vault's central thesis]] applied across contexts
