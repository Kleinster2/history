# The Business Firm

The modern corporation—a legal entity with perpetual life, limited liability, transferable shares, and centralized management—is one of humanity's most consequential inventions. It solved a fundamental problem: how to pool capital from strangers for risky ventures without bankrupting anyone. This legal fiction, developed over five centuries from Italian partnerships to Delaware incorporations, is the invisible infrastructure beneath every modern business. Without it, industrial capitalism is impossible—no one risks their entire fortune on a stranger's factory.

## Overview

### The Problem It Solved

| Without Corporate Form | With Corporate Form |
|------------------------|---------------------|
| Partners liable for all debts | Liability capped at investment |
| Death dissolves the firm | Perpetual existence |
| Can't sell your stake easily | Transferable shares |
| Trust only family/friends | Pool capital from strangers |
| Small scale | Unlimited scale possible |

### Evolution

| Era | Form | Innovation |
|-----|------|------------|
| Ancient | Sole trader | Individual enterprise |
| Medieval | Partnership | Shared risk, shared profit |
| 1400s-1600s | Commenda/societas | Limited partner concept |
| 1600s | Chartered company | State-granted monopoly, joint-stock |
| 1800s | General incorporation | Anyone can incorporate |
| 1900s | Managerial corporation | Ownership separated from control |
| 2000s | Platform/network | Asset-light, global |

## Ancient and Medieval: Partnerships

### Roman Societas

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Form | Partnership agreement |
| Liability | Unlimited, personal |
| Duration | Life of partners |
| Scale | Limited |
| Legacy | Legal foundation for later forms |

### Italian Innovations (1200s-1400s)

| Form | Innovation |
|------|------------|
| Commenda | Sleeping partner (capital) + active partner (labor) |
| Liability split | Sleeping partner risks only investment |
| Societas maris | Maritime trade partnerships |
| Compagnia | Family firm (Medici, Bardi, Peruzzi) |
| Duration | Still dissolved on death |

### The Medici Model

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Structure | Hub of partnerships |
| Each branch | Separate legal entity |
| Risk containment | Branch failure doesn't kill whole |
| Innovation | Decentralized management |
| Limitation | Still family-based, personal |

---

## Chartered Companies (1500s-1800s)

### The Innovation

| Feature | Significance |
|---------|--------------|
| State charter | Government creates the entity |
| Joint-stock | Multiple investors pool capital |
| Monopoly rights | Exclusive trade in a region |
| Perpetual capital | Investors can't withdraw |
| Transferable shares | Sell your stake to others |

### Key Companies

| Company | Founded | Innovation |
|---------|---------|------------|
| Muscovy Company | 1555 | Early joint-stock |
| [[East India Companies\|English EIC]] | 1600 | Permanent capital (from 1657) |
| [[Dutch Golden Age\|VOC]] | 1602 | First publicly traded shares |
| Hudson's Bay | 1670 | Territorial governance |
| South Sea Company | 1711 | Spectacular failure (1720) |

### Why Charters Were Needed

| Reason | Logic |
|--------|-------|
| No general law | Couldn't just "form a company" |
| Sovereign grant | Only state could create legal persons |
| Monopoly incentive | Reward risk with exclusive rights |
| Control | State maintained oversight |
| Limitation | Few companies, politically connected |

### The Bubble Act (1720-1825)

| Event | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| South Sea Bubble | Speculation disaster |
| Bubble Act (1720) | Banned unchartered joint-stock companies |
| Duration | 105 years (UK) |
| Effect | Forced business into partnerships |
| Repeal (1825) | Opened path to general incorporation |

---

## The Limited Liability Revolution (1800s)

### The Key Laws

| Law | Country | Innovation |
|-----|---------|------------|
| Société en commandite | France (1807) | Limited partnership codified |
| Repeal of Bubble Act | UK (1825) | Joint-stock possible again |
| Joint Stock Companies Act | UK (1844) | Registration (not charter) |
| Limited Liability Act | UK (1855) | Shareholders risk only investment |
| Companies Act | UK (1862) | Combined: registration + limited liability |
| General incorporation | US (various states, 1811+) | Anyone can form a corporation |
| Aktiengesetz | Germany (1870) | Joint-stock corporation (AG) for large firms |
| GmbH law | Germany (1892) | Limited liability for small firms—enabled [[German Business Model\|Mittelstand]] |
| Commercial Code | Japan (1893) | Meiji-era wholesale import of Western corporate law |
| Colonial company law | British Empire (1860s+) | UK Companies Act extended to India, Hong Kong, etc. |

### Why Limited Liability Mattered

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| Invest in a factory → risk your house | Risk only what you invest |
| Only the rich dare | Middle class can invest |
| Few investors per venture | Many investors possible |
| Capital scarce | Capital abundant |
| Personal trust required | Legal structure substitutes |

### The Debate

| For (1850s argument) | Against |
|----------------------|---------|
| Encourages investment | Moral hazard (risk without consequence) |
| Democratizes capitalism | Protects fraudsters |
| Enables large enterprises | Creditors bear the loss |
| Economic growth | Reckless behavior |
| Won | But critics had a point |

### US: The Race to the Bottom

| Development | Effect |
|-------------|--------|
| New Jersey (1889) | Liberal incorporation laws |
| Delaware (1899) | Even more permissive |
| Competition | States compete for incorporations |
| Result | Delaware = 65% of Fortune 500 |
| Logic | Corporate-friendly courts, flexible law |

### Global Variations

Different countries created different forms for different purposes—revealing what each economy valued:

| Country | Form | Character |
|---------|------|-----------|
| UK/US | Public corporation | Dispersed shareholders, stock market funding |
| Germany | AG + GmbH | Large firms (AG) with codetermination; small firms (GmbH) with flexibility |
| France | SA + SARL | State-influenced, elite-managed |
| Japan | KK (kabushiki kaisha) | Imported Western law (1893), but cross-shareholding made it function differently |
| British colonies | UK Companies Act copies | India, Hong Kong, Singapore inherited Anglo corporate law |
| Latin America | SA (sociedad anónima) | French/Spanish civil law tradition |

The legal form was portable; the social reality was not. The same "corporation" means something different when embedded in German codetermination, Japanese keiretsu, or Korean chaebol family control.

## The Managerial Revolution (1900s)

### Berle and Means (1932)

| Observation | Implication |
|-------------|-------------|
| Ownership dispersed | Thousands of shareholders |
| Control concentrated | Professional managers run firms |
| Separation | Owners don't manage; managers don't own |
| Power shift | Managers have effective control |
| Problem | Who do managers serve? |

This is also when wealth accumulation shifted from families to firms. Before Berle and Means, a company's wealth was functionally the owner's wealth—Carnegie's steel profits were Carnegie's money. After the managerial revolution, retained earnings became *the corporation's* wealth, allocated by professional managers with no controlling stake. The legal groundwork (limited liability, corporate personhood) had separated firm and family on paper since the 1850s; the managerial corporation made it real. But this Anglo-American path is the exception: in Japan, family zaibatsu were dissolved by political force (1945-47); in Germany, wealth accumulated for stakeholders via codetermination; in Korea and Southeast Asia, [[Korean Chaebol|chaebol]] and [[Overseas Chinese Networks|family conglomerates]] never fully separated; in China, firms accumulate at the party-state's pleasure. Dispersed-shareholder capitalism is one solution, not *the* solution.

### The M-Form (Chandler)

| Structure | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Before | Functional departments (sales, production) |
| After | Divisions by product or geography |
| Innovation | General Motors (Sloan, 1920s) |
| Advantage | Diversification + accountability |
| Spread | Standard by 1960s |

### The Corporate Person

The US developed corporate personhood through constitutional case law—a uniquely American path:

| Right | Gained |
|-------|--------|
| Contract | Always (fundamental) |
| Property | Always |
| Due process | 14th Amendment (1886, Santa Clara) |
| Free speech | Citizens United (2010) |
| Religious freedom | Hobby Lobby (2014) |
| Controversy | Are corporations people? |

Civil law countries reached similar results through statute, not courts:

| Tradition | Mechanism | Character |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| French | *Personne morale* | Legal personality granted by code |
| German | *Juristische Person* | Statutory entity with rights/duties |
| Japanese | *Hōjin* | Imported from German legal theory (1890s) |
| Common law (US/UK) | Case law + statute | Gradual, judge-made, contested |

The practical result is similar—firms can own property, sue, and persist beyond their founders. But the American version is uniquely expansive (speech rights, religious freedom), while civil law systems treat corporate personality as a functional convenience rather than a constitutional identity.

| Jensen & Meckling (1976) | Agency theory |
| Williamson | Transaction cost economics |

### Coase's Question (1937)

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| Why do firms exist? | Markets have transaction costs |
| Why not do everything via contract? | Negotiation, monitoring expensive |
| Firm boundary | Where internal coordination is cheaper |
| Modern challenge | Internet reduces transaction costs |
| Implication | Firms should shrink? (outsourcing, platforms) |

|-------------|-----------|
| Industrial Revolution | Pooled capital for factories |

| Political power | Corporate lobbying, capture |
| Inequality | Returns to capital vs. labor |
| Accountability | Who's responsible when corporations harm? |
