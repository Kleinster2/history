# The Business Firm

The modern corporation—a legal entity with perpetual life, limited liability, transferable shares, and centralized management—is one of humanity's most consequential inventions. It solved a fundamental problem: how to pool capital from strangers for risky ventures without bankrupting anyone. This legal fiction, developed over five centuries from Italian partnerships to Delaware incorporations, is the invisible infrastructure beneath every modern business. Without it, industrial capitalism is impossible—no one risks their entire fortune on a stranger's factory.

## Overview

### The Problem It Solved

| Without Corporate Form | With Corporate Form |
|------------------------|---------------------|
| Partners liable for all debts | Liability capped at investment |
| Death dissolves the firm | Perpetual existence |
| Can't sell your stake easily | Transferable shares |
| Trust only family/friends | Pool capital from strangers |
| Small scale | Unlimited scale possible |

### Evolution

| Era | Form | Innovation |
|-----|------|------------|
| Ancient | Sole trader | Individual enterprise |
| Medieval | Partnership | Shared risk, shared profit |
| 1400s-1600s | Commenda/societas | Limited partner concept |
| 1600s | Chartered company | State-granted monopoly, joint-stock |
| 1800s | General incorporation | Anyone can incorporate |
| 1900s | Managerial corporation | Ownership separated from control |
| 2000s | Platform/network | Asset-light, global |

| Form | Partnership agreement |
| Liability | Unlimited, personal |
| Duration | Life of partners |
| Scale | Limited |
| Legacy | Legal foundation for later forms |

### Italian Innovations (1200s-1400s)

| Commenda | Sleeping partner (capital) + active partner (labor) |
| Liability split | Sleeping partner risks only investment |
| Societas maris | Maritime trade partnerships |
| Compagnia | Family firm (Medici, Bardi, Peruzzi) |
| Duration | Still dissolved on death |

### The Medici Model

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Structure | Hub of partnerships |

| Risk containment | Branch failure doesn't kill whole |
| Innovation | Decentralized management |
| Limitation | Still family-based, personal |

---

## Chartered Companies (1500s-1800s)

### The Innovation

| Feature | Significance |
|---------|--------------|
| State charter | Government creates the entity |
| Joint-stock | Multiple investors pool capital |
| Monopoly rights | Exclusive trade in a region |
| Perpetual capital | Investors can't withdraw |
| Transferable shares | Sell your stake to others |

### Key Companies

| [[Dutch Golden Age\|VOC]] | 1602 | First publicly traded shares |
| Hudson's Bay | 1670 | Territorial governance |
| South Sea Company | 1711 | Spectacular failure (1720) |

### Why Charters Were Needed

| Reason | Logic |
|--------|-------|
| No general law | Couldn't just "form a company" |
| Sovereign grant | Only state could create legal persons |
| Monopoly incentive | Reward risk with exclusive rights |
| Control | State maintained oversight |
| Limitation | Few companies, politically connected |

### The Bubble Act (1720-1825)

| Event | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| South Sea Bubble | Speculation disaster |
| Bubble Act (1720) | Banned unchartered joint-stock companies |

| Invest in a factory → risk your house | Risk only what you invest |

| Democratizes capitalism | Protects fraudsters |
| Enables large enterprises | Creditors bear the loss |
| Economic growth | Reckless behavior |

| Logic | Corporate-friendly courts, flexible law |
