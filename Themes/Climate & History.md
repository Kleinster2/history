# Climate & History

Climate has shaped human history more profoundly than most narratives acknowledge. Ice ages determined human migration, rainfall patterns enabled or destroyed civilizations, and climate shifts contributed to the fall of empires. From the Medieval Warm Period's agricultural expansion to the Little Ice Age's famines, temperature and precipitation drove economic outcomes. Climate is not destiny, but it sets the constraints within which societies operate.

## Overview

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Timespan | All human history |
| Impact | Agriculture, migration, collapse |
| Evidence | Ice cores, tree rings, records |
| Debate | Determinism vs. adaptation |

## Climate and Human Evolution

### Ice Ages

| Period | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Pleistocene glacials | Human adaptation |
| Interglacials | Range expansion |
| Last Glacial Maximum | ~21,000 BP |
| Holocene | Current warm period |

### Migration

| Climate Event | Human Response |
|---------------|----------------|
| Ice ages | Beringia crossing |
| Sahara wet phases | African expansion |
| Sea level changes | Coastal effects |

## Agriculture Origins

### Holocene Transition

| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Warming | Stable conditions |
| Predictability | Enables planning |
| [[Fertile Crescent]] | Ideal conditions |
| Multiple centers | Similar timing |

### Climate Requirements

| Need | For Agriculture |
|------|-----------------|
| Rainfall | Minimum required |
| Temperature | Growing season |
| Predictability | Planning crops |
| Stability | Investment payoff |

## Ancient Civilizations

### Climate and Rise

| Civilization | Climate Factor |
|--------------|----------------|
| Egypt | Nile floods (predictable) |
| Mesopotamia | Irrigation needed |
| Indus | Monsoon dependent |
| China | Yellow River flooding |

### Climate and Collapse

| Collapse | Climate Factor |
|----------|----------------|
| [[Bronze Age Collapse]] | 1200 BCE drought |
| Maya | 9th century droughts |
| Akkadian Empire | 2200 BCE aridification |
| Ancestral Puebloans | 13th century drought |

## Medieval Climate

### Medieval Warm Period (900-1300 CE)

| Effect | Region |
|--------|--------|
| Agricultural expansion | Northern Europe |
| Viking Greenland | Settlement possible |
| Population growth | Europe |
| Viticulture | England |

### Economic Impact

| Change | Result |
|--------|--------|
| Longer growing season | More food |
| New lands cultivated | Expansion |
| Trade | Increased |
| Cities | Growth |

## Little Ice Age (1300-1850)

### Climate

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Cooling | ~1°C average |
| Variability | Extreme events |
| Glacial advance | Alps, Scandinavia |
| Duration | Centuries |

### Economic Effects

| Impact | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Crop failures | Frequent famines |
| Shorter seasons | Reduced yields |
| Disease | Weakened populations |
| Social unrest | Witch trials |

### Notable Events

| Event | Date |
|-------|------|
| Great Famine | 1315-1317 |
| Year Without Summer | 1816 |
| Irish Famine | 1845-1852 |

## Climate and Empire

### Mongol Expansion

| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Wet period | Grassland expansion |
| Horse fodder | Cavalry supported |
| Timing | 13th century |

### Roman Optimum

| Period | 200 BCE - 200 CE |
|--------|------------------|
| Climate | Warm, stable |
| Agriculture | Productive |
| Trade | Flourished |
| Decline | Cooling after |
