# Technology History

Technology—the application of knowledge to practical purposes—has driven economic change throughout human history. From stone tools to artificial intelligence, technological innovation has increased productivity, transformed societies, and created new possibilities. Understanding technological change means understanding invention, diffusion, adoption, and the social contexts that enable or constrain innovation.
