# Positivism in Practice

Auguste Comte believed society could be governed scientifically—experts discovering social laws and managing accordingly. This vision never died. It reappeared in developmental states, Cold War coups, international financial institutions, and central bank independence. The pattern: experts claim to know what voters don't, and institutions are designed to insulate "correct" policy from democratic interference. The backlash—populism—is the democratic revenge.

## The Positivist Promise

| Claim | Implication |
|-------|-------------|
| Society follows discoverable laws | Experts can find them |
| Science is objective | Expert policy isn't ideology |
| Progress is linear | Development has stages |
| Irrationality causes problems | Rational management solves them |

Comte's "positive" stage: humanity outgrows theology and metaphysics, embraces science. Applied to governance: replace politics with administration, debate with data, democracy with expertise.

## Developmental States

### The Model

| Feature | Logic |
|---------|-------|
| State-led industrialization | Markets won't develop industry fast enough |
| Technocratic planning | Experts allocate resources |
| Insulated bureaucracy | Shield planners from political pressure |
| Selective repression | Silence labor, left opposition |
| Compressed development | Skip stages, catch up fast |

### Case Studies

| Country | Period | Key Features | Outcome |
|---------|--------|--------------|---------|
| **Meiji Japan** | 1868-1912 | State-created industries, samurai-bureaucrats | Industrialized in one generation |
| **Kemalist Turkey** | 1923-1950s | Secular modernization, étatism | Mixed; military as guardian |
| **Park's Korea** | 1961-1979 | Chaebol system, export discipline | "Miracle on the Han" |
| **Lee's Singapore** | 1965-1990 | One-party technocracy | First-to-third world |
| **Deng's China** | 1978-present | Party controls, markets deliver | Largest development success |

**The pattern**: Authoritarian politics + technocratic economics = rapid growth (sometimes). Democracy deferred until development "complete."

### What Made It Work (When It Did)

| Factor | Mechanism |
|--------|-----------|
| Competent bureaucracy | Meritocratic recruitment, insulation from politics |
| External discipline | Export targets, competition |
| Land reform | Broke oligarchy, created rural markets |
| Education investment | Human capital for industry |
| US security umbrella | Cold War allies got aid, market access |

### What Made It Fail (When It Did)

| Factor | Examples |
|--------|----------|
| Corruption | Philippines under Marcos, Indonesia under Suharto |
| Cronyism over competence | Latin American ISI |
| No feedback mechanisms | Soviet planning |
| Rent-seeking | Protected industries never competed |

## Cold War Coups

### The Pattern

| Stage | What Happened |
|-------|---------------|
| 1. Democratic election | Left-wing or populist government wins |
| 2. Economic "chaos" | Real or manufactured crisis |
| 3. Elite panic | Property owners, military, US alarmed |
| 4. Coup | Military seizes power |
| 5. Technocrats arrive | Economists implement "correct" policy |
| 6. Repression | Unions, left parties, critics silenced |
| 7. "Miracle" claimed | Growth attributed to policy, not repression |

### The Cases

| Country | Year | Elected Government | Coup Justification | Technocratic Policy |
|---------|------|-------------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **Guatemala** | 1954 | Arbenz (land reform) | Anti-communism | Reversed reform |
| **Brazil** | 1964 | Goulart (labor, land) | Anti-communism | Stabilization, repression |
| **Indonesia** | 1965-66 | Sukarno (nationalist) | Anti-communism | Berkeley Mafia economists |
| **Chile** | 1973 | Allende (socialist) | Economic chaos | Chicago Boys |
| **Argentina** | 1976 | Perónists | "Dirty War" | Neoliberal reform |
| **Turkey** | 1980 | Unstable coalitions | Order restoration | Özal's liberalization |

### The Chilean Laboratory

Chile under Pinochet (1973-1990) became the purest case of positivist economics in practice:

| Phase | Policy | Result |
|-------|--------|--------|
| 1973-75 | Shock therapy, privatization | Deep recession, unemployment |
| 1975-82 | Chicago Boys in charge | Growth, then 1982 crash |
| 1982-85 | State bailouts of banks | Pragmatic retreat |
| 1985-90 | Modified neoliberalism | Recovery, but inequality |

**The Chicago Boys**: Chilean economists trained at University of Chicago (Friedman, Harberger). They saw Chile as laboratory—a chance to implement textbook policy without democratic interference.

| What They Claimed | What Critics Saw |
|-------------------|------------------|
| Scientific economics | Ideology with equations |
| Neutral expertise | Class warfare from above |
| Market freedom | Freedom for capital, repression for labor |
| Miracle growth | Inequality, precarity, 1982 crash |

**The uncomfortable question**: Did Chile succeed *because of* or *despite* the Chicago Boys? Growth resumed after 1985, but so did pragmatic state intervention. The "miracle" narrative served ideological purposes.

## International Financial Institutions

### The Washington Consensus

By the 1980s, positivist economics became global policy via IMF and World Bank:

| Principle | Policy |
|-----------|--------|
| Fiscal discipline | Cut deficits |
| Tax reform | Broaden base, lower rates |
| Interest rate liberalization | Market-determined rates |
| Competitive exchange rates | Devalue if overvalued |
| Trade liberalization | Cut tariffs |
| FDI liberalization | Open to foreign investment |
| Privatization | Sell state enterprises |
| Deregulation | Remove barriers to entry |
| Property rights | Secure and enforce |

### Structural Adjustment

| Mechanism | How It Worked |
|-----------|---------------|
| Debt crisis | Countries can't pay loans |
| IMF conditionality | Reform in exchange for bailout |
| Policy imposed | Elected governments constrained |
| Technocrats empowered | Finance ministers vs. parliaments |
| Social costs | Austerity hits poor hardest |

**The pattern repeated**: Crisis → external experts arrive → "correct" policy imposed → democracy circumvented → social costs → eventual backlash.

### Case: Greece 2010-2018

| Year | Event |
|------|-------|
| 2010 | Debt crisis; troika (EU, ECB, IMF) bailout |
| 2010-14 | Austerity imposed; GDP falls 25% |
| 2015 | Syriza elected on anti-austerity platform |
| 2015 | Referendum rejects troika terms (61% "No") |
| 2015 | Syriza accepts terms anyway |
| 2018 | "Exit" from bailout; economy still depressed |

**The lesson**: Democratic vote rejected policy that was then imposed anyway. Expertise (or creditor power) trumped democracy.

## Central Bank Independence

### The Quiet Revolution

| Development | Date | Significance |
|-------------|------|--------------|
| Fed independence reinforced | 1951 (Treasury-Fed Accord) | Monetary policy insulated |
| Bundesbank model | 1957 | Inflation-fighting mandate |
| New Zealand inflation targeting | 1990 | Explicit numerical target |
| ECB created | 1998 | Most independent ever designed |
| Global spread | 1990s-2000s | Independence becomes orthodoxy |

### The Logic

| Claim | Argument |
|-------|----------|
| Politicians cause inflation | Electoral cycle leads to loose money |
| Credibility requires independence | Markets trust insulated technocrats |
| Rules over discretion | Clear targets reduce uncertainty |
| Expertise over democracy | Monetary policy too complex for voters |

### The Critique

| Problem | Manifestation |
|---------|---------------|
| Distributional effects | Low rates help asset owners |
| Unemployment tolerance | Inflation prioritized over jobs |
| Democratic deficit | Major policy made by unelected officials |
| Epistemic limits | 2008 showed experts failed too |
| Class bias | Central bankers share financier worldview |

## The EU: Positivism Institutionalized

### The Design

| Institution | Function | Democratic Accountability |
|-------------|----------|--------------------------|
| European Commission | Proposes legislation | Appointed, not elected |
| European Central Bank | Monetary policy | Explicitly independent |
| European Court of Justice | Interprets treaties | Judges, not voters |
| Stability and Growth Pact | Fiscal rules | Constrains elected governments |
| Troika (crisis) | Conditionality | Overrides national democracy |

### The Theory

"Embedded liberalism" + technocracy: markets with rules, managed by experts. National democracies constrained by treaties, courts, and institutions they can't easily change.

### The Crisis

| Tension | Example |
|---------|---------|
| Monetary union without fiscal union | Greece can't devalue |
| Rules vs. discretion | Pact violated, then enforced selectively |
| Creditors vs. debtors | Germany vs. Southern Europe |
| Expertise vs. democracy | Troika vs. Syriza |

**Juncker's dictum** (2015): "There can be no democratic choice against the European treaties."

## The Backlash: Populism

### The Pattern

| Phase | Development |
|-------|-------------|
| 1. Technocratic overreach | Policies imposed despite opposition |
| 2. Democratic humiliation | Voters ignored or overridden |
| 3. Economic pain | Austerity, inequality, dislocation |
| 4. Elite discrediting | Experts failed (2008) or lied (Iraq) |
| 5. Populist mobilization | "The people" vs. "the elite" |
| 6. Institutional challenge | Attack on courts, central banks, EU |

### Left Populism

| Movement | Country | Target |
|----------|---------|--------|
| Syriza | Greece | Troika, austerity |
| Podemos | Spain | Austerity, corruption |
| Corbyn Labour | UK | Neoliberal consensus |
| Sanders | US | Wall Street, inequality |
| AMLO | Mexico | Neoliberal technocracy |

### Right Populism

| Movement | Country | Target |
|----------|---------|--------|
| Brexit | UK | EU, immigration |
| Trump | US | Globalization, experts |
| Orbán | Hungary | EU, liberal institutions |
| Le Pen | France | EU, immigration |
| Bolsonaro | Brazil | PT technocracy, corruption |

### What Populism Gets Right

| Critique | Validity |
|----------|----------|
| Experts serve interests | Often true; financier capture of policy |
| Democracy was circumvented | True in many cases |
| Costs fell on ordinary people | True; austerity hurt workers most |
| Elites protected themselves | 2008 bailouts confirm this |

### What Populism Gets Wrong

| Problem | Risk |
|---------|------|
| Simple solutions | Complex problems don't have easy fixes |
| Scapegoating | Immigrants, minorities blamed |
| Institutional destruction | Courts, central banks serve functions |
| Authoritarian drift | "The people" becomes the leader |

## The Deeper Pattern

### The Cycle

```
Democratic excess (perceived)
        ↓
Technocratic correction
        ↓
Democratic exclusion
        ↓
Populist backlash
        ↓
Democratic excess (perceived)
        ↓
    [repeat]
```

### The Unresolved Tension

| Positivist Claim | Democratic Claim |
|------------------|------------------|
| Some questions have right answers | Legitimacy requires consent |
| Experts know more than voters | Experts have interests too |
| Long-term thinking requires insulation | Accountability requires responsiveness |
| Markets have laws | Markets are political constructs |

### The Real Question

Is there knowledge that should constrain democracy? Monetary policy? Climate science? Public health? Or is every such claim a power play?

The positivist answer: Yes, expertise should override ignorance.

The democratic answer: Who decides what counts as expertise?

The synthesis (maybe): Expertise informs democracy but doesn't replace it. Technocrats advise; voters decide. Institutions constrain but remain accountable.

No one has solved this. The tension between expert knowledge and democratic legitimacy is permanent. Positivism in practice oscillates between overreach and backlash, guardianship and populism, science and politics.
