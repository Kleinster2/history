# Religion & Economy

Religion and economy have been inseparable throughout history. Temples were the first large institutions—organizing labor, storing surplus, recording transactions. Religious beliefs shaped economic behavior: what could be traded, when work stopped, how wealth was distributed. From Mesopotamian temple economies to Weber's Protestant ethic, understanding economic history requires understanding religious institutions and ideologies.
