# Legal Services

Legal services are the invisible infrastructure of market economies. Without lawyers drafting contracts, litigating disputes, and navigating regulations, business transactions would be far more costly, uncertain, and limited in scope. From Roman advocates through medieval canon lawyers to modern global law firms, the legal profession has evolved alongside commerce—and shaped it. The rise of the mega-firm (Cravath, Skadden, Freshfields) in the 20th century was a business innovation as significant as any in manufacturing: creating organizations that could handle the legal complexity of multinational corporations.

## The Deeper Point

Legal services are the transaction cost infrastructure that determines the scale and complexity of business possible in a society. Where courts are reliable, contracts enforceable, and legal expertise available, strangers can transact at scale—the complex webs of contracts that constitute modern corporations, supply chains, and financial markets become possible. Where legal infrastructure is weak, business stays personal, local, and relationship-based because the [[Institutions and Progress|institutional]] mechanisms for trusting strangers don't exist. The Cravath system—training elite lawyers, deploying them hierarchically, and serving corporate clients—was itself a business innovation that created the organizational form suited to modern corporate complexity. The modern mega-firm (1,000+ lawyers, global offices, billion-dollar revenues) is the legal equivalent of the [[Foundational Firms|managerial corporation]]: a solution to the problem of coordinating specialized expertise at scale. But legal services also show the limits of markets: the profession is heavily regulated (bar admission, ethical rules, unauthorized practice), reflecting the judgment that pure market provision of legal services would be dangerous. The [[Varieties of Capitalism]] framework applies: common-law adversarial systems (US, UK) produce more lawyers, more litigation, and different business strategies than civil-law systems (Germany, France). [[State Capacity|State capacity]] is circular here—strong legal infrastructure requires capable courts, but capable courts require a functioning legal profession. The deeper insight: every business transaction is embedded in a legal framework, and the quality of that framework determines how ambitious [[Entrepreneurship|entrepreneurs]] can be and what forms their ambition takes.
