# Knowledge Preservation

Knowledge preservation—how societies save, transmit, and recover information across generations—shapes economic development and civilizational continuity. From oral traditions to digital archives, the methods of preservation determine what survives. Libraries, monasteries, academies, and archives have served as knowledge repositories. The loss of the [[Library of Alexandria]] and medieval manuscript destruction remind us how fragile knowledge can be.

## Overview
