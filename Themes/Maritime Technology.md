# Maritime Technology

Ships changed history. Each breakthrough in maritime technology expanded what humans could trade, where they could go, and how much they could carry. From dugout canoes to container ships, the story of ship technology is the story of shrinking distances and growing markets. The caravel opened oceans; the steamship conquered wind; the container ship made global supply chains possible.

## Overview

### Why Ships Matter

|--------|-----------------|
| Cost | Sea transport 10-40x cheaper than land |
| Capacity | Bulk goods viable over distance |
| Speed | Faster than overland (usually) |
| Range | Connect distant markets |

### The Arc of Progress

| Era | Key Ship | Breakthrough |
|-----|----------|--------------|
