# Shipping and Maritime Trade

Shipping costs determine what can be traded—and therefore the shape of the global economy. From Phoenician galleys to mega-container ships, the ability to move goods across water has enabled civilizations to specialize, trade, and grow rich. Shipping is where geography meets technology meets institutions: natural harbors matter, but so do shipbuilding skills and legal frameworks for maritime commerce. The container revolution (1956) was as important as any technological breakthrough in enabling modern globalization—by making distance nearly irrelevant for manufactured goods.

## The Deeper Point

Shipping is [[Institutions and Progress|institutional]] infrastructure for global trade—the physical layer that enables [[Entrepreneurship|entrepreneurial]] activity across borders. The cost of moving goods determines what can be traded: when shipping is expensive, only high-value goods travel; when cheap, everything does. Containerization made distance nearly irrelevant for manufactured goods, enabling global supply chains, Asian export industrialization, and consumer abundance in rich countries. But shipping also shows how technology requires institutional support: marine insurance (Lloyd's), admiralty law, port infrastructure, and canal treaties all had to be developed. The industry's flags of convenience represent [[Business Regulation|regulatory]] arbitrage—capital flowing to minimal-rule jurisdictions. Shipping's extreme cyclicality reflects a coordination problem: ordering ships takes years, so capacity overshoots and undershoots demand. The chokepoint vulnerabilities (Suez, Malacca) reveal that globalization depends on a few narrow passages—and on geopolitical stability to keep them open. The 2020s disruptions (COVID, Suez, Red Sea) are teaching this lesson again. Shipping enabled the gains from trade that drove [[Globalization]]—and its fragilities may reshape it.
