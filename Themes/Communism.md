# Communism

Communism—the ideology advocating collective ownership of the means of production and the abolition of private property and classes—emerged from 19th-century socialist thought, particularly Marx's analysis of capitalism. Communist states established in the 20th century (Soviet Union, China, others) attempted centrally planned economies with mixed results: rapid industrialization but political repression and economic inefficiencies. The communist experiment provides important evidence for debates about economic systems.
