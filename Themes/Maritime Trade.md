# Maritime Trade

Maritime trade—commerce by sea—has connected distant regions throughout history. Cheaper than overland transport by orders of magnitude, sea trade enabled bulk goods to move long distances, creating integrated economies across oceans. From Bronze Age Mediterranean to modern container shipping, maritime trade shaped which societies prospered and which declined. Control of sea routes meant control of commerce.
