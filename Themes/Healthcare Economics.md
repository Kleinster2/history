# Healthcare Economics

Healthcare defies normal economic rules. Patients can't easily comparison shop during emergencies. Doctors know more than patients. Insurance separates consumption from payment. Life-and-death stakes make cost-benefit analysis uncomfortable. The result: healthcare markets produce outcomes that would be unacceptable in other sectors—costs that double without doubling quality, prices that vary 10x for identical procedures, 30 million Americans uninsured while spending more per capita than any other country. Healthcare economics examines why this sector is so different and what, if anything, can be done.

## Overview

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| US spending | $4.5 trillion (18% of GDP) |
| Growth | Consistently faster than GDP |
| Outcome | Mediocre by rich-country standards |
| Unique features | Insurance, information asymmetry, moral stakes |
| Debate | Market vs. regulation vs. single-payer |

### Demand Characteristics

| Feature | Implication |
|---------|-------------|
| Unpredictable | Can't plan for heart attack |
| Inelastic | Will pay almost anything |
| Urgent | No time for price shopping |
| Agency | Doctor decides what you "need" |

### Supply Characteristics

| Feature | Implication |
|---------|-------------|
| Licensing | Supply constrained |
| Specialization | Long training, limited substitution |
| Information monopoly | Patients can't evaluate quality |

|-----------|-----------------|
| MRI | $400 - $4,000 |
| Hip replacement | $20,000 - $100,000 |
| Appendectomy | $5,000 - $50,000 |
| Explanation | No price transparency, no competition |

### Where Money Goes

| Category | Share of Spending |
|----------|-------------------|
| Hospital care | 31% |
| Physician services | 20% |
| Prescription drugs | 10% |
| Other professionals | 10% |
| Administrative | 8% |
| Other | 21% |

### Administrative Costs

| US vs. Canada | US costs 2x+ administrative |
|---------------|----------------------------|
| Multiple insurers | Different billing, forms |
| Prior authorization | Time-consuming requirements |
| Billing complexity | Thousands of codes |
| Estimate | $500 billion+ in waste |

## Insurance Economics

### Why Insurance Exists

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Risk | Pooling spreads costs |
| Large expenses | Catastrophic coverage |
| Uncertainty | Peace of mind |

### Insurance Market Failures

| Problem | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Adverse selection | Sick people buy more insurance |
| Moral hazard | Insured people use more care |
| Death spiral | Healthy leave → premiums rise → more leave |
| Pre-existing conditions | Uninsurable individually |

### US Insurance Structure

| Type | Coverage |
|------|----------|
| Employer-sponsored | 155 million |
| Medicare (65+) | 65 million |
| Medicaid (low-income) | 85 million |
| Individual market | 15 million |
| Uninsured | 28 million |

### Employer-Based Insurance

| Origin | WWII wage controls → benefits instead |
|--------|-------------------------------------|
| Tax treatment | Employer premiums tax-exempt |
| Problems | Job lock, coverage gaps |
| Scale | Still majority of working-age coverage |

## Baumol's Cost Disease

### The Theory

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Productivity growth | Lower in services |
| Healthcare | Labor-intensive, hard to automate |
| Wages | Must match productive sectors |
| Result | Relative costs rise forever |

### Application to Healthcare

| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Doctor visits | Still take time |
| Nursing care | Can't be outsourced |
| Surgeries | Productivity gains limited |
| Counter | Some technology gains (imaging, etc.) |

### Implication

| Prediction | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| Healthcare share rises | Inevitable in rich countries |
| Not all waste | Some is Baumol effect |
| Policy | Distinguish waste from structural |

## Pharmaceutical Economics

### Drug Pricing

| Feature | US vs. Others |
|---------|---------------|
| Price negotiation | US Medicare can't (mostly) |
| Branded drugs | 2-3x higher in US |
| Generics | Comparable or lower |
| Reason | Free-rider on US profits |

### Innovation Trade-off

| Argument | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| For high prices | Fund R&D, incentivize innovation |
| Against | Rents exceed R&D spending |
| Complication | Global benefits, US bears cost |

### Patent System

| Feature | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| 20-year patents | Monopoly pricing period |
| Evergreening | Extend through modifications |
| Pay-for-delay | Brand pays generic to stay out |
| Biosimilars | Slower adoption than generics |

| Challenges | Wait times, political feasibility (US) |

### Multi-Payer

| Model | Multiple insurers, regulated |
|-------|------------------------------|
| Examples | Germany, Netherlands, Switzerland |
| Advantages | Choice, competition |
| Challenges | Coordination, still complex |

### National Health Service

| Model | Government owns and operates |
|-------|------------------------------|
| Examples | UK, Spain |
| Advantages | Cost control, universal access |
| Challenges | Capacity constraints, funding politics |

### US Incremental Reforms

| Reform | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Medicare (1965) | Universal 65+ coverage |
| Medicaid (1965) | Low-income coverage |
| COBRA (1985) | Continuation coverage |
| ACA (2010) | Exchanges, mandates, Medicaid expansion |
| Unresolved | Still 28 million uninsured |

## Quality and Value

### Measuring Healthcare Value

| Challenge | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Output definition | What's a unit of health? |
| Quality adjustment | Better outcomes with higher cost? |
| Patient variation | Same treatment, different results |
| Long-term effects | Hard to attribute |

### Value-Based Care

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Fee-for-service | Pay per procedure (traditional) |
| Capitation | Pay per patient |
| Bundled payments | Pay per episode |
| Outcomes-based | Pay for results |
| Challenge | Measurement, risk adjustment |

### Quality Variation

| Finding | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Dartmouth Atlas | Huge regional variation in spending |
| No correlation | More spending ≠ better outcomes |
| Implication | Much care unnecessary or harmful |

## Demographics and the Future

### Aging Population

| Trend | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| 65+ share growing | Higher utilization |
| Last year of life | 25% of Medicare spending |
| Chronic disease | Managing, not curing |
| Projection | Medicare trust fund pressures |

### Technology

| Innovation | Effect on Costs |
|------------|-----------------|
| New treatments | Often additive, not substitutive |
| Imaging | More tests, not always better |
| Biologics | Expensive, effective |
| AI potential | Diagnosis, administration savings |

## The Deeper Point

Healthcare economics reveals the limits of [[Capitalism\|market]] solutions for certain problems. The conditions for efficient markets—informed consumers, price competition, easy entry and exit—simply don't hold. Patients can't evaluate quality. Prices are hidden. Emergencies preclude shopping. The result is a sector where spending more doesn't produce better outcomes, where identical services cost 10x different amounts, where insurance creates as many problems as it solves. The US system is the extreme case: combining the inefficiencies of private insurance with the political constraints that block simpler solutions. Other rich countries found workable compromises—single-payer, regulated multi-payer, national health services—that cover everyone at lower cost with equal or better outcomes. The US inability to do so reflects not economic constraints but political ones: the [[Institutions and Progress\|institutional]] path dependence of employer-sponsored insurance, the lobbying power of healthcare interests, and ideological resistance to government provision. [[Baumol's Cost Disease]] means healthcare will claim a growing share of GDP regardless of system—the question is whether that spending will be efficient and equitable.
