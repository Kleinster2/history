# Behavioral Economics

The challenge to rational actor assumptions. Behavioral economics shows why institutions are necessary—humans aren't rational optimizers, so structures that channel behavior matter.

## Origins

### The Rational Actor Problem

| Neoclassical Assumption | Observed Reality |
|-------------------------|------------------|
| Perfect information | Limited knowledge |
| Unlimited computation | Cognitive limits |
| Consistent preferences | Context-dependent choices |
| Self-interest maximization | Fairness, reciprocity, spite |

### Founding Figures

| Thinker | Contribution |
|---------|--------------|
| Herbert Simon (1916-2001) | Bounded rationality, satisficing |
| Amos Tversky (1937-1996) | Heuristics, prospect theory |
| Daniel Kahneman (1934-2024) | Judgment under uncertainty |
| Richard Thaler (1945-) | Mental accounting, nudges |

## Core Concepts

### Bounded Rationality

| Concept | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| Satisficing | Good enough, not optimal |
| Limited attention | Can't process everything |
| Rules of thumb | Heuristics simplify |
| Ecological rationality | Heuristics often work |

### Heuristics

| Heuristic | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Availability | Judge by what comes to mind |
| Representativeness | Match to stereotypes |
| Anchoring | Stick near starting point |
| Recognition | Familiar = good |

### Biases from Heuristics

| Bias | Effect |
|------|--------|
| Overconfidence | Overestimate own knowledge |
| Hindsight | "Knew it all along" |
| Confirmation | Seek supporting evidence |
| Base rate neglect | Ignore prior probabilities |

## Prospect Theory

### Kahneman-Tversky Framework

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Reference point | Gains and losses relative to status quo |
| Loss aversion | Losses hurt ~2x as much as gains please |
| Diminishing sensitivity | First $100 matters more than next $100 |
| Probability weighting | Overweight small probabilities |

### Implications

| Prediction | Example |
|------------|---------|
| Risk-averse for gains | Take sure $100 over 50% chance of $200 |
| Risk-seeking for losses | Gamble to avoid sure loss |
| Endowment effect | Own it → value it more |
| Status quo bias | Stick with default |

## Mental Accounting

### Thaler's Framework

| Concept | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| Mental accounts | Separate budgets in mind |
| Fungibility violation | Money isn't interchangeable |
| Sunk cost fallacy | Consider irrecoverable costs |
| House money effect | Risk more with "winnings" |

### Examples

| Behavior | Mental Accounting |
|----------|-------------------|
| Vacation splurging | "Vacation money" different from "grocery money" |
| Refusing to sell losers | Don't close the mental account at a loss |
| Tax refund spending | "Found money" spent differently |

## Time Inconsistency

### Present Bias

| Observation | Problem |
|-------------|---------|
| Prefer $100 now to $110 tomorrow | But $100 in 30 days vs. $110 in 31 days? |
| Discount hyperbolically | Near future weighted heavily |
| Self-control problems | Can't stick to plans |
| Procrastination | Now is special |

### Commitment Devices

| Device | Function |
|--------|----------|
| Retirement auto-enrollment | Make saving default |
| Deadline setting | Create external constraint |
| Illiquid savings | Can't access easily |
| Public commitments | Reputation at stake |

## Social Preferences

### Beyond Self-Interest

| Preference | Evidence |
|------------|----------|
| Fairness | Reject unfair offers (ultimatum game) |
| Reciprocity | Reward kindness, punish meanness |
| Altruism | Give even when anonymous |
| Spite | Pay to hurt defectors |

### Experimental Evidence

| Game | Finding |
|------|---------|
| Ultimatum | Reject 80-20 splits |
| Dictator | Give 20-30% even anonymously |
| Public goods | Contribute, punish free-riders |
| Trust | Trust strangers, reciprocate trust |

## Market Implications

### Financial Markets

| Anomaly | Explanation |
|---------|-------------|
| Equity premium puzzle | Loss aversion raises required returns |
| Bubbles | Herding, overconfidence |
| Momentum | Underreaction, then overreaction |
| Calendar effects | Mental accounting |

### Consumer Markets

| Phenomenon | Bias |
|------------|------|
| Sales effectiveness | Anchoring on "original" price |
| Subscription traps | Status quo bias |
| Warranties | Loss aversion, risk overweighting |
| Free offers | Zero is special |

## Policy Implications

### Nudge Theory

| Principle | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| Default power | Opt-out vs. opt-in |
| Choice architecture | How options are presented |
| Libertarian paternalism | Preserve choice, guide outcomes |
| EAST | Easy, Attractive, Social, Timely |

### Applications

| Domain | Nudge |
|--------|-------|
| Retirement | Auto-enrollment in 401(k) |
| Organ donation | Presumed consent |
| Energy | Comparison to neighbors |
| Health | Smaller plates |

### Behavioral Public Policy

| Area | Intervention |
|------|--------------|
| Tax compliance | Social norm messages |
| Smoking | Graphic warnings |
| Savings | Commitment savings accounts |
| Voting | "I voted" stickers |

## Critiques

### From Neoclassical

| Critique | Response |
|----------|----------|
| Lab ≠ real world | Field experiments confirm |
| High stakes fix biases | Evidence mixed |
| Markets discipline | Arbitrage limited |
| Just noise | Systematic patterns |

### From Left

| Critique | Concern |
|----------|---------|
| Paternalistic | Who decides what's best? |
| Ignores power | Nudging for whose benefit? |
| Individual focus | Structural problems remain |
| Manipulation | Corporate use of biases |

### Internal Debates

| Issue | Positions |
|-------|-----------|
| When do biases matter? | High stakes vs. experience |
| Universal vs. cultural | Are biases biological? |
| Prediction | Can behavioral predict better? |
| Normative status | Are biases irrational? |

## Relationship to Institutions

### Why Institutions Exist

| Human Limitation | Institutional Response |
|------------------|----------------------|
| Self-control problems | Commitment devices (contracts) |
| Trust problems | Reputation systems, courts |
| Coordination failure | Conventions, laws |
| Information overload | Decision defaults |

### Institutional Design

| Insight | Application |
|---------|-------------|
| Defaults matter | Set good defaults |
| Framing matters | Present choices carefully |
| Salience matters | Make important things visible |
| Social proof | Use norms and comparisons |

## The Deeper Point

Behavioral economics shows why [[Institutions and Progress|institutions]] are necessary—humans aren't rational optimizers, so structures that channel behavior matter. If people were perfectly rational, institutions would merely facilitate exchange. But because people are loss-averse, present-biased, overconfident, and susceptible to framing, institutions do more: they shape choices, constrain impulses, and create environments where good decisions are easier.

This insight has profound implications for understanding economic history:
- [[Speculative Bubbles]] recur because herding and overconfidence are hardwired
- [[Financial Crisis Theory|Financial crises]] spread because panic is contagious
- [[Property Rights]] must be *visible* and *salient*, not just legally valid
- [[Guild Economics|Guilds]] provided commitment devices for quality and training
- Modern [[Securities Regulation|regulations]] try to debias through disclosure

The institutional economics tradition asks *which* institutions channel ambition productively. Behavioral economics explains *why* channeling is necessary—because human psychology doesn't automatically optimize. Together, they suggest that good institutions are those that account for how people actually think and behave, not how rational actor models assume they should.
