# State Formation

States—centralized political organizations with monopolies on legitimate violence—emerged independently in several regions starting around 3500 BCE. From Mesopotamian city-states to Chinese dynasties, states created the institutions that organized large-scale economic activity: taxation, law, currency, infrastructure. Understanding why and how states formed means understanding the political foundations of economic development.
