# Energy Transitions

Energy is the master constraint. Each transition—biomass to coal, coal to oil, fossil fuels to electricity—enabled new economic possibilities and created new dependencies. The [[Timber Crisis]] drove the shift to coal, which enabled the [[Industrial Revolution]]. Oil powered the automobile and shaped 20th-century geopolitics. Electricity became the universal energy carrier. Now decarbonization demands another transition—but this one is deliberate, not market-driven, and must happen faster than any before.

## Overview

| Era | Dominant source | Economic system |
|-----|-----------------|-----------------|
| Pre-industrial | Biomass, muscle | Agricultural |
| 1800-1950 | Coal | Industrial |
| 1950-present | Oil (+ coal, gas) | Automobile, consumer |
| Future? | Renewables, nuclear | Decarbonized |

## Biomass Era

### Energy Sources

| Source | Use |
|--------|-----|
| Wood | Heating, cooking, charcoal |
| Charcoal | Smelting, metallurgy |
| Muscle | Human and animal power |
| Wind | Sailing, mills |
| Water | Mills |

### Constraints

| Limit | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| Deforestation | [[Timber Crisis]] |
| Land competition | Food vs. fuel |
| Muscle power | Limited scale |
| Location | Near water, wind |

### Pre-Industrial Ceiling

| Constraint | Implication |
|------------|-------------|
| Energy limited | Economic growth capped |
| Biomass renewable | But slowly, if at all |
| Local | Couldn't transport far |

## Coal Transition

### Why Coal

| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| [[Timber Crisis]] | Wood scarce, expensive |
| Abundant | Britain had lots |
| Energy density | More per unit weight |
| Steam engine | Enabled pumping, transport |

### Coal's Effects

| Change | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Location freedom | Not tied to water power |
| Scale | Larger operations possible |
| Urbanization | Cities not forest-limited |
| Industries | Iron, steam, textiles |

### The Industrial Revolution Connection

| Link | Mechanism |
|------|-----------|
| Steam engines | Pumped mines, powered factories |
| Iron production | Coke instead of charcoal |
| Transportation | Steam locomotives |
| Scale | Concentrated power |

### Geographic Advantage

| Coal-rich | Early industrialization |
|-----------|------------------------|
| Britain | First |
| Belgium | Second |
| Germany | Rising 19th c. |
| US | Large reserves |

## Oil Age

### The Transition

| Period | Development |
|--------|-------------|
| 1860s | Oil industry begins |
| 1900s | Automobiles |
| 1920s+ | Oil dominant in transport |
| Post-WWII | Petrochemical age |

### Why Oil Dominated

| Advantage | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| Energy density | Highest |
| Liquid | Easy to transport, store |
| Versatile | Transport, chemicals, heating |
| Cost | Initially cheap |

### [[Oil Economy|Oil's]] Economic Effects

| Effect | Mechanism |
|--------|-----------|
| Automobile society | Personal transport |
| Suburbs | Urban form |
| Petrochemicals | Plastics, chemicals |
| Geopolitics | Middle East importance |

### Dependencies Created

| Dependency | Character |
|------------|-----------|
| Transport | Almost entirely oil |
| Petrochemicals | Oil-based |
| Geopolitical | Oil importers vulnerable |
| Infrastructure | Built for cars |

## Electrification

### The Second Industrial Revolution

| Innovation | Effect |
|------------|--------|
| Generators | Convert mechanical to electric |
| Motors | Convert electric to mechanical |
| Grid | Distribute power |
| Light | Illumination |

### Why Electricity Matters

| Property | Significance |
|----------|--------------|
| Universal carrier | Any source, any use |
| Flexible | Precise control |
| Clean at point of use | Cities cleaner |
| Divisible | Any scale |

### Economic Effects

| Effect | Mechanism |
|--------|-----------|
| Factory organization | Motors at each machine |
| New industries | Aluminum, chemicals |
| Consumer goods | Appliances |
| Information | Electronics, computing |

## Current Transition

### The Climate Imperative

| Challenge | Requirement |
|-----------|-------------|
| Climate change | Decarbonization |
| Speed | Faster than past transitions |
| Scale | Global |
| Nature | Policy-driven, not market-only |

### Transition Technologies

| Technology | Status |
|------------|--------|
| Solar | Cost competitive |
| Wind | Cost competitive |
| Batteries | Improving rapidly |
| Nuclear | Contested |
| Hydrogen | Developing |

### Economic Challenges

| Challenge | Character |
|-----------|-----------|
| Infrastructure | Built for fossil fuels |
| Stranded assets | Fossil investments |
| Intermittency | Sun doesn't always shine |
| Equity | Costs and benefits distribution |

### Differences from Past Transitions

| Past transitions | Current transition |
|------------------|-------------------|
| Market-driven | Policy-driven |
| New source cheaper | Often not (yet) |
| Gradual | Must be rapid |
| Accidental | Deliberate |

## The Deeper Point

Energy transitions are the master narrative of economic history. Biomass limited pre-industrial societies to what sun and photosynthesis could provide. Coal broke that constraint—Britain's [[Industrial Revolution]] was fundamentally a [[Timber Crisis|coal transition]], escaping the organic energy ceiling. Oil shaped the 20th century: automobiles, suburbs, petrochemicals, Middle East geopolitics. Electricity became the universal carrier—any primary source can generate it, any end use can consume it. Each transition enabled new economic possibilities while creating new dependencies. Coal required miners and railroads; oil required refineries and pipelines; electricity required grids and generators. Now [[Climate and Economy|climate change]] demands another transition—but unlike past shifts, this one must be deliberate, rapid, and global. Market forces alone won't achieve it quickly enough; [[Institutions and Progress|institutions]]—carbon prices, regulations, subsidies—must drive it. The energy transition underway is unique: not toward a cheaper or more convenient source, but toward one that doesn't destabilize the climate. Whether economies can manage a deliberate energy transition at the required speed is the central [[Development Economics|development]] question of the 21st century.
