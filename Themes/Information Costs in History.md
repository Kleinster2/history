# Information Costs in History

Information has never been free. The costs of knowing—prices, quality, reliability, intentions—shaped economic organization throughout history. When information was expensive, trust networks emerged. When technology reduced costs, markets transformed. Understanding information costs illuminates why certain institutions arose and what made them obsolete.

## What Are Information Costs?

### Types

| Cost | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Search | Finding trading partners |
| Verification | Confirming quality, identity |
| Communication | Transmitting knowledge |
| Enforcement | Knowing if agreements are kept |
| Coordination | Synchronizing actions |

### Economic Consequences

| High Information Costs | Low Information Costs |
|------------------------|----------------------|
| Local trade | Distance trade |
| Personal relationships | Anonymous markets |
| Reputation networks | Formal contracts |
| Specialized intermediaries | Direct exchange |

## Pre-Modern Information

### Speed Limits

| Era | Maximum Speed |
|-----|---------------|
| Ancient | Horse, ship (~100 miles/day max) |
| Medieval | Same |
| Early Modern | Same |
| 1844+ | Telegraph (instant) |

### What This Meant

| Activity | Constraint |
|----------|------------|
| Price knowledge | Days/weeks old |
| Credit verification | Impossible at distance |
| Contract enforcement | Local only |
| Market arbitrage | Slow, risky |

## Trust Networks as Information Infrastructure

### Why Trust Networks?

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Can't verify strangers | Trade with known parties |
| Can't enforce distant contracts | Community enforcement |
| Can't assess quality | Reputation within network |
| Can't communicate quickly | Network members share |

### Historical Examples

| Network | Region | Period |
|---------|--------|--------|
| [[Merchant Diaspora Networks\|Maghribi traders]] | Mediterranean | 11th century |
| [[Chinese Diaspora Capitalism\|Overseas Chinese]] | Southeast Asia | 16th century+ |
| [[Armenian merchants]] | Eurasian | 17th century |
| [[Quaker merchants]] | Atlantic | 18th century |

### How Networks Reduced Costs

| Mechanism | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| Shared identity | Easy recognition |
| Reputation circulation | Cheaters known |
| Community punishment | Exclusion costly |
| Cultural similarity | Expectations aligned |

### The Greif Model

| Finding | Implication |
|---------|-------------|
| Maghribi traders | Coalition for information-sharing |
| Reputation | Circulated within network |
| Punishment | Collective exclusion |
| Cost | Lower within network, higher outside |

## Intermediaries as Information Processors

### The Merchant Function

| Service | Value Added |
|---------|------------|
| Know suppliers | Buyer doesn't need to search |
| Know buyers | Seller doesn't need to search |
| Assess quality | Expertise |
| Bear risk | Information asymmetry |
| Extend credit | Reputation-based |

### Medieval Fairs

| Function | Information Role |
|----------|-----------------|
| Concentrated trading | Reduced search costs |
| Quality standards | Guild certification |
| Credit clearing | Debt netting |
| Relationship building | Annual meetings |

### Banking as Information

| Service | Information Role |
|---------|-----------------|
| Credit assessment | Know borrowers |
| Payment clearing | Track transfers |
| Letters of credit | Certify identity, solvency |
| Bills of exchange | Portable reputation |

## Printing and Information Costs

### Before Printing

| Feature | Reality |
|---------|---------|
| Book production | Manuscript copying |
| Cost | Years of scribe labor |
| Distribution | Limited, elite |
| Knowledge | Concentrated |

### After Gutenberg (1450)

| Change | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Cost per copy | Dropped 80%+ |
| Availability | Mass production possible |
| Standardization | Same text everywhere |
| Speed | Faster knowledge diffusion |

### Economic Effects

| Domain | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Price lists | Could be published, distributed |
| Technical manuals | Knowledge spread |
| Laws and contracts | Standardized forms |
| Commercial correspondence | Printed formats |

## Communication Technology Revolutions

### Each Revolution

| Technology | Information Cost Effect |
|------------|------------------------|
| Writing | Enabled recording |
| Printing | Reduced reproduction cost |
| [[Postal Systems]] | Reduced transmission cost |
| [[Telegraph Revolution\|Telegraph]] | Eliminated transmission time |
| Telephone | Enabled conversation |
| Internet | Near-zero for everything |

### Price Convergence Data

| Commodity | Pre-Telegraph Spread | Post-Telegraph |
|-----------|---------------------|----------------|
| Cotton (1840s) | 10%+ across cities | <2% |
| Wheat (1870s) | 20%+ NY-Chicago | <5% |
| Securities | Local pricing | National markets |

### Arbitrage Implications

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| Merchant profit from price differences | Arbitrage profit eliminated |
| Information was competitive advantage | Commodity |
| Local specialists | Global competition |

## Institutions Shaped by Information Costs

### The Firm

| Coase's Insight | Implication |
|-----------------|-------------|
| Firms exist because of transaction costs | Including information costs |
| When market costs high | Integrate |
| When market costs low | Outsource |
| Technology changes | Optimal firm boundary shifts |

### Vertical Integration

| High Info Costs | Low Info Costs |
|-----------------|----------------|
| Own suppliers | Contract out |
| Own distribution | Use market |
| Corporate hierarchy | Network organization |

### The Evolution

| Era | Firm Structure |
|-----|----------------|
| Pre-telegraph | Local, small |
| Railway/telegraph | National corporations |
| Telephone/computer | Multinationals |
| Internet | Platforms, gig economy |

## Quality Information

### The "Lemons Problem"

| Akerlof's Insight | Implication |
|-------------------|-------------|
| Buyers can't assess quality | Adverse selection |
| Good products driven out | By bad |
| Market failure | Without quality signals |

### Historical Solutions

| Institution | How It Worked |
|-------------|---------------|
| [[Guilds]] | Quality certification |

| Misinformation | Verification harder |
| Privacy | Information too available |
| Attention | Scarce, monetized |

## The Deeper Point

Information costs are among the most important [[Institutions and Progress|institutional constraints]] in economic history. When knowing was expensive, economies organized around that constraint: trust networks, specialized intermediaries, local markets, integrated firms. When technology reduced information costs, institutions adapted: networks became less important, markets expanded, firms restructured.

The Coasian insight applies throughout history: the boundary between market and hierarchy reflects transaction costs, of which information is a major component. The Northian insight adds that institutions themselves are information processors—property registries, contract law, reputation systems all reduce the cost of economic coordination.

The historical pattern suggests that each information technology revolution—writing, printing, telegraph, internet—enabled new institutional forms while making others obsolete. The medieval merchant whose competitive advantage was knowing prices in distant markets became unnecessary when telegraph spread that information instantly. The corporate hierarchy built for coordination became less necessary when internet enabled direct connection.

But information technology doesn't determine institutional outcomes. The same technology can be deployed in different institutional frameworks—centralized or decentralized, egalitarian or extractive, open or controlled. How societies organize information infrastructure remains a choice, and those choices shape who benefits from reduced information costs.
