# Urbanization History

From villages to megacities. The shift from rural to urban living is one of history's most profound transformations. In 1800, 3% of humans lived in cities; today over 55% do. Understanding urbanization—its causes, patterns, and consequences—illuminates economic development, since cities concentrate the specialization, exchange, and innovation that drive growth.

## The Long Arc

| Period | Urban Share | Largest City |
|--------|-------------|--------------|
| 3000 BCE | <5% | Uruk (~50,000) |
| 1 CE | ~10% | Rome (~1 million) |
| 1000 CE | ~5% | Córdoba, Kaifeng |
| 1800 | ~3% | Beijing (~1 million) |
| 1900 | ~15% | London (~6 million) |
| 2000 | ~47% | Tokyo (~34 million) |
| 2024 | ~56% | Tokyo (~37 million) |

## Ancient Cities

### First Urban Revolution (~3500-3000 BCE)

| Region | Cities | Character |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| Mesopotamia | Uruk, Ur | Temple-centered |
| Egypt | Memphis, Thebes | Royal capitals |
| Indus | Mohenjo-daro, Harappa | Planned layouts |
| China | Erlitou (later) | Palace-centered |

### Why Cities Emerged

| Factor | Mechanism |
|--------|-----------|
| Agricultural surplus | Feed non-farmers |
| Irrigation | Coordination, administration |
| Trade | Exchange nodes |
| Religion | Temple complexes |
| Defense | Walls, concentration |

### Ancient Urban Economies

| Feature | Character |
|---------|-----------|
| Palace/temple | Central redistribution |
| Markets | Limited but present |
| Crafts | Specialized production |
| Trade | Long-distance luxury |

## Classical Urbanism

### Mediterranean Cities

| City | Peak Population |
|------|-----------------|
| Athens | ~300,000 (with Attica) |
| Rome | ~1 million (1st-2nd c. CE) |
| Alexandria | ~500,000 |
| Carthage | ~500,000 |

### Rome's Achievement

| Feature | Significance |
|---------|--------------|
| Scale | First million-person city |
| Supply | Grain from Egypt, Africa |
| Infrastructure | Aqueducts, roads, sewers |
| Consumption city | Political/military center |

### Asian Parallels

| City | Character |
|------|-----------|
| Chang'an | Tang capital, cosmopolitan |
| Kaifeng | Song commercial center |
| Baghdad | Abbasid capital, trade hub |

## Medieval Urban Revival

### Europe's Re-urbanization

| Period | Development |
|--------|-------------|
| 500-1000 | Urban decline |
| 1000-1300 | Revival, new towns |
| Key cities | Venice, Florence, Bruges |

### Medieval Urban Functions

| Function | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| Trade | Venice, Bruges, Lübeck |
| Production | Florence textiles |
| Finance | Florence, Genoa |
| Religion | Cathedral towns |

### Urban Autonomy

| Feature | Significance |
|---------|--------------|
| Charters | Legal independence |
| Guilds | Self-governance |
| Walls | Defense, identity |
| "City air" | Freedom from serfdom |

## Industrial Urbanization

### The Explosion

| Country | Urban % 1800 | Urban % 1900 |
|---------|--------------|--------------|
| Britain | 20% | 77% |
| Germany | 25% | 54% |
| United States | 6% | 40% |
| France | 25% | 41% |

### Why Industry → Cities

| Factor | Mechanism |
|--------|-----------|
| Coal location | Factories near mines |
| Labor needs | Workers concentrated |
| Transport | Rail nodes |
| Markets | Consumer proximity |

### Urban Conditions

| Problem | Severity |
|---------|----------|
| Housing | Overcrowded slums |
| Sanitation | Disease epidemics |
| Pollution | Coal smoke, waste |
| Life expectancy | Lower than rural |

### Reform and Improvement

| Innovation | Effect |
|------------|--------|
| Sanitation | Sewers, water supply |
| Planning | Zoning, parks |
| Transit | Streetcars, subways |
| Housing | Regulation, public housing |

## Developing World Urbanization

### The Current Wave

| Region | Urban % 1950 | Urban % 2020 |
|--------|--------------|--------------|
| Africa | 14% | 43% |
| Asia | 17% | 51% |
| Latin America | 41% | 81% |

### Characteristics

| Feature | Pattern |
|---------|---------|
| Speed | Faster than historical |
| Scale | Megacities (10M+) |
| Informality | Slums, informal employment |
| Services | Often precede industry |

### Urban Challenges

| Problem | Manifestation |
|---------|---------------|
| Housing | Slums, informal settlements |
| Infrastructure | Inadequate services |
| Employment | Informal sector |
| Governance | Limited state capacity |

## Why Cities Drive Growth

### Agglomeration Economics

| Mechanism | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| Thick labor markets | Better matching |
| Input sharing | Specialized suppliers |
| Knowledge spillovers | Ideas spread |
| Competition | Forces innovation |

### Evidence

| Finding | Source |
|---------|--------|
| Productivity premium | ~5% per doubling of density |
| Innovation concentration | Patents cluster in cities |
| Wage premium | Urban wages higher |
| Persistence | Cities remain for centuries |

### Limits

| Diseconomy | Cost |
|------------|------|
| Congestion | Time, pollution |
| Land costs | Housing unaffordability |
| Crime | Social costs |
| Disease | Density spreads illness |

## The Deeper Point

Urbanization is both consequence and cause of economic development. Cities form because agglomeration creates value—the concentration of people enables specialization, exchange, and innovation impossible in dispersed populations. But cities also drive development, providing the density that makes markets work, ideas spread, and institutions scale.

The [[Institutions and Progress|institutional]] dimension is crucial. Cities require governance—water, sanitation, security, property rights—that villages can do without. The urban premium depends on these public goods; without them, cities become disease traps and poverty concentrators. The difference between nineteenth-century Manchester (initially lethal) and late-nineteenth-century Manchester (improving) was institutional: public health, housing regulation, infrastructure investment.

Historical patterns suggest urbanization is irreversible. Very few societies have de-urbanized except through catastrophe (Rome's collapse, Bronze Age collapse). Once the institutional and infrastructural investments are made, cities persist for millennia. Ancient trade routes still shape modern urban networks; medieval market towns became industrial cities.

The current developing-world urbanization poses unprecedented challenges. Cities are growing faster than the institutions needed to govern them. The result is informality—unofficial settlements, informal employment, extra-legal arrangements. Whether these cities become engines of growth or poverty traps depends on institutional development catching up with demographic change.
