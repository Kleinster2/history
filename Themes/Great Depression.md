# Great Depression

The Great Depression (1929-1939) was the worst economic crisis in modern history—a global catastrophe that saw output collapse, unemployment soar, trade plummet, and political extremism rise. Beginning with the US stock market crash, the depression spread worldwide through trade and financial linkages. The crisis discredited laissez-faire economics, transformed the role of government, and contributed to World War II. Its lessons shaped post-war economic policy.
