# Speculative Bubbles

The pattern across crises—from tulips to crypto. Bubbles recur because human psychology is constant—the question is what [[Institutions and Progress|institutions]] limit their damage.

## The Pattern

### Kindleberger-Minsky Model

| Phase | Characteristics |
|-------|-----------------|
| Displacement | New technology, policy, or opportunity |
| Boom | Prices rise, credit expands |
| Euphoria | "New era" thinking, everyone joins |
| Profit-taking | Smart money exits |
| Panic | Crash, credit contraction, contagion |
| Revulsion | Overcorrection, distress |

### Minsky's Instability Hypothesis

| Stage | Financing Type |
|-------|----------------|
| Hedge | Income covers interest and principal |
| Speculative | Income covers interest only (roll principal) |
| [[Ponzi Schemes\|Ponzi]] | Income covers neither (rely on price appreciation) |
| Transition | Stability breeds risk-taking |

## Classic Bubbles

| Crashes | 80%+ declines each time |
| Ongoing | Technology persists, speculation continues |

## Why Bubbles Recur

### Psychological Factors

| Bias | Role in Bubbles |
|------|-----------------|
| Overconfidence | "I'll sell before the crash" |
| Herding | Follow the crowd |
| Recency bias | Recent gains predict future |
| FOMO | Fear of missing out |
| Confirmation | Seek supporting evidence |
| Narrative thinking | Stories over statistics |

### Structural Factors

| Factor | Mechanism |
|--------|-----------|
| Leverage | Amplifies gains and losses |
| Credit expansion | Fuels buying |
| New participants | "Greater fools" available |
| Information asymmetry | Insiders exit first |
| Agency problems | Managers take risks with others' money |

### "This Time Is Different"

| Claim | Reality |
|-------|---------|
| New technology | Maybe, but valuations still matter |
| Fundamentals | Eventually matter |
| New era | History doesn't repeat but rhymes |
| Sophisticated investors | Biased like everyone else |

## Are Bubbles Rational?

### Rational Bubble Theory

| Argument | Implication |
|----------|-------------|
| Everyone knows it's a bubble | But expects to sell to greater fool |
| Momentum trading | Profitable until it isn't |
| Arbitrage limits | Hard to short bubbles |
| Career risk | Fund managers follow crowd |

### Limits to Arbitrage

| Problem | Consequence |
|---------|-------------|
| Short-selling costs | Expensive, limited supply |
| Margin calls | Can't wait for crash |
| Noise trader risk | Bubble can grow before popping |
| Synchronization | All shorts must coordinate |

## Institutional Responses

### Prevention Attempts

| Tool | Effectiveness |
|------|---------------|
| Central bank warnings | Limited ("irrational exuberance") |
| Margin requirements | Reduce leverage |
| Interest rates | Blunt instrument |
| Macro-prudential | Counter-cyclical buffers |
| Bubble pricking | Controversial, often fails |

### Damage Control

| Institution | Function |
|-------------|----------|
| Lender of last resort | Liquidity in crisis |
| Deposit insurance | Prevent bank runs |
| Circuit breakers | Pause trading |
| Resolution regimes | Orderly failure |
| Bailouts | Controversial but common |

### Moral Hazard Problem

| Intervention | Consequence |
|--------------|-------------|
| Bailouts | Expect rescue, take more risk |
| "Greenspan/Bernanke put" | Fed will cushion falls |
| Too big to fail | Implicit guarantee |
| Solution? | Pre-commitment, living wills |

## Bubbles and Innovation

### The Perez Framework

| Phase | Relationship |
|-------|--------------|
| Installation | New technology, speculation |
| Crash | Overbuilding revealed |
| Deployment | Infrastructure used productively |
| Synergy | Broad benefits |

### Infrastructure Legacy

| Bubble | Infrastructure Left |
|--------|---------------------|
| Canals | Waterway network |
| Railways | Track network |
| Dot-com | Fiber optic, data centers |
| Telecom | Cellular networks |

### Are Bubbles Necessary?

| View | Argument |
|------|----------|
| Functional | Revolutionary tech needs irrational capital |
| Wasteful | Better institutions could allocate efficiently |
| Inevitable | Human psychology + uncertainty = bubbles |
| Mixed | Some waste, some infrastructure |

## Cross-Asset Patterns

### What Gets Bubbled

| Asset Class | Examples |
|-------------|----------|
| Stocks | 1929, dot-com, many country episodes |
| Real estate | Japan 1989, US 2008, many others |
| Commodities | Oil 2008, gold various |
| Currencies | Various emerging market episodes |
| Collectibles | Tulips, art, NFTs |
| Crypto | Bitcoin, altcoins |

### Common Features

| Pattern | Manifestation |
|---------|---------------|
| Credit expansion | Precedes bubble |
| New narrative | Justifies prices |
| Leverage increase | Amplifies |
| Insider selling | Near peak |
| Contagion | Crash spreads |

## The Deeper Point

Bubbles recur because human psychology is constant—[[Behavioral Economics|overconfidence, herding, FOMO, narrative thinking]] don't change across centuries. The assets change (tulips, railways, dotcoms, crypto) but the pattern persists: displacement, boom, euphoria, crash, revulsion.

The [[Institutional Economics|institutional question]] is what structures limit damage when bubbles inevitably occur. Deposit insurance prevents bank runs. Margin requirements limit leverage. Lenders of last resort provide liquidity in panic. Resolution regimes enable orderly failure. These institutions don't prevent bubbles—that may be impossible given human psychology—but they can limit systemic damage.

The hardest question is whether bubbles have functional value. Railway mania built railways. Dot-com mania built fiber optic networks. Perhaps irrational exuberance is how societies mobilize capital for uncertain, transformative investments. If so, the institutional challenge isn't eliminating bubbles but channeling their energy: building infrastructure rather than just shuffling claims, leaving assets rather than just debris.

The historical pattern suggests institutions learn from crises—slowly, imperfectly, with backsliding. Each major bubble produces reform (1929 → SEC, 2008 → Dodd-Frank). Whether the reforms are sufficient for the *next* bubble is unknowable until it arrives. The only certainty is that there will be a next one.
