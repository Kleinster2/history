# Why Nations Fail

*Why Nations Fail: The Origins of Power, Prosperity, and Poverty* (2012) by Daron Acemoglu and James Robinson is the most influential work on institutions and development of the 21st century. Its core argument—that **inclusive institutions** create prosperity while **extractive institutions** cause poverty—has shaped policy debates, academic research, and how millions understand global inequality. The book synthesizes decades of research into an accessible narrative, using history from Rome to the Congo to contemporary China.

## Overview

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Authors | Daron Acemoglu (MIT), James Robinson (Chicago) |
| Published | 2012 |
| Core thesis | Institutions—not geography, culture, or ignorance—explain prosperity |
| Key distinction | Inclusive vs. extractive institutions |
| Influence | Bestseller, policy framework, academic citations |

## The Central Argument

### The Puzzle

| Observation | Question |
|-------------|----------|
| Massive income gaps | Why is the US 30x richer than Ethiopia? |
| Persistent poverty | Why do some countries stay poor? |
| Divergent paths | Why did South Korea succeed where North Korea failed? |

### Rejected Explanations

| Theory | Acemoglu & Robinson's Rebuttal |
|--------|-------------------------------|
| Geography | Nogales, AZ vs. Nogales, Sonora—same geography, different outcomes |
| Culture | South Korea vs. North Korea—same culture, vast gap |
| Ignorance | Leaders know what works; they choose extraction |

### The Answer: Institutions

| Type | Characteristics | Outcome |
|------|-----------------|---------|
| Inclusive | Broad participation, secure property, rule of law | Prosperity |
| Extractive | Narrow elite, insecure property, arbitrary rule | Poverty |

## Inclusive vs. Extractive

### Political Institutions

| Inclusive | Extractive |
|-----------|------------|
| Pluralistic—power distributed | Power concentrated |
| Accountable to citizens | Accountable to no one |
| Constraints on rulers | Rulers unconstrained |
| Broad coalition | Narrow elite |

### Economic Institutions

| Inclusive | Extractive |
|-----------|------------|
| Secure property rights | Property at ruler's whim |
| Open entry—anyone can start a business | Entry restricted to cronies |
| Contracts enforced | Contracts depend on connections |
| Level playing field | Rules favor insiders |

### The Relationship

| Direction | Logic |
|-----------|-------|
| Political → Economic | You need political inclusion for economic inclusion |
| Why? | Extractive elites won't permit economic competition |
| Virtuous circle | Inclusive institutions reinforce each other |
| Vicious circle | Extractive institutions reinforce each other |

## Historical Cases

### England's Glorious Revolution (1688)

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| King could seize property | Parliament protected property |
| Monopolies granted by crown | Markets opened |
| Rule by decree | Rule of law |
| Result | Industrial Revolution followed |

**The argument:** The Glorious Revolution constrained the king, secured property rights, and opened economic opportunity. This institutional shift—not coal, not culture—explains why Britain industrialized first.

### Spain and Latin America

| Pattern | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Conquest | Extractive institutions from the start |
| Encomienda | Forced labor, extraction |
| Colonial legacy | Institutions persisted after independence |
| Result | Persistent underdevelopment |

**The argument:** Spanish colonies were designed for extraction. The conquistadors wanted gold, not development. These institutions survived independence and continue to shape Latin America.

### North vs. South Korea

| North Korea | South Korea |
|-------------|-------------|
| Communist dictatorship | Eventually democratized |
| State owns everything | Private property, markets |
| Innovation punished | Innovation rewarded |
| GDP/capita: $1,800 | GDP/capita: $35,000 |

**The argument:** Same people, same culture, same history until 1945. Different institutions after division. The gap is 100% institutional.

### Botswana vs. Zimbabwe

| Botswana | Zimbabwe |
|----------|----------|
| Constrained leadership | Mugabe's unconstrained rule |
| Property rights protected | Land seizures |
| Diamond wealth shared | Resources extracted |
| Prosperous | Collapsed |

**The argument:** Both African, both resource-rich, both post-colonial. Botswana's leaders chose inclusive institutions; Mugabe chose extraction.

## The Colonial Origins Research

### The Natural Experiment

| Logic | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Where Europeans settled | They built inclusive institutions |
| Where Europeans died | They built extractive institutions |
| Settler mortality | Predicted institutional type |
| Persistence | Colonial institutions lasted centuries |

### Reversal of Fortune

| Then (1500) | Now |
|-------------|-----|
| Aztec, Inca empires—wealthy | Mexico, Peru—middle income |
| North America—sparse | United States—rich |
| Explanation | Europeans extracted from rich areas, settled poor ones |

### The 2001 Paper

| Finding | Implication |
|---------|-------------|
| Institutions cause growth | Not reverse causation |
| Geography matters only through institutions | Not directly |
| Colonial origins are instrumental variable | Identifies causal effect |

---

## Why Extractive Institutions Persist

### The Political Logic

| Problem | Mechanism |
|---------|-----------|
| Inclusive institutions threaten elites | They would lose rents |
| Elites control politics | Can block reform |
| Creative destruction | Threatens existing powers |
| Result | Elites choose stagnation over losing power |

### Historical Examples

| Case | Pattern |
|------|---------|
| Ottoman printing ban | Elites feared disruption |
| Russian railroad delay | Nobles feared change |
| Chinese exam system | Bureaucrats protected monopoly |
| African post-colonial | New elites captured existing extractive institutions |

### The Vicious Circle

```
Extractive institutions
    → Elite captures wealth
        → Elite controls politics
            → Elite blocks inclusive reform
                → Extractive institutions persist
```

## Critical Transitions

### When Change Happens

| Factor | Role |
|--------|------|
| Critical juncture | Crisis, shock, or opportunity |
| Institutional drift | Small differences accumulate |
| Contingency | Outcomes aren't determined |
| Examples | Black Death, Atlantic trade, decolonization |

### England's Path

| Juncture | Institutional Effect |
|----------|---------------------|
| Magna Carta (1215) | Some constraints on king |
| Black Death (1348) | Peasants gained power |
| Atlantic trade (1500s) | Merchants gained wealth, challenged crown |
| Civil War (1640s) | Parliament vs. king |
| Glorious Revolution (1688) | Decisive shift to inclusive |

### Why England, Not Spain?

| England | Spain |
|---------|-------|
| Wool trade → distributed wealth | Silver → concentrated in crown |
| Parliament had power | Cortes marginalized |
| Merchants in politics | Merchants excluded |
| Inclusive path | Extractive path |

## Critiques

### Reductionism

| Critique | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| All institutions equal? | Treating diverse institutions as binary |
| What about culture? | Dismissed too quickly |
| What about geography? | Still matters in some ways |

### Endogeneity Concerns

| Critique | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Do institutions cause growth? | Or does growth enable institutions? |
| Colonial instruments questioned | Validity debates |
| Selection effects | Maybe good institutions are result of development |

### China Problem

| Challenge | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| China grew fast | Under extractive political institutions |
| A&R's response | Extractive growth can't last; China will stall or liberalize |
| Counter | Maybe they're wrong about the politics-economics link |

### Implementation

| Critique | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| "Get institutions right" | Easier said than done |
| Washington Consensus failed | Imposing institutions didn't work |
| Context matters | What works depends on circumstances |

## Influence

### On Policy

| Area | Impact |
|------|--------|
| Development | Institutions now central |
| Aid | Focus shifted to governance |
| Reform | Property rights, rule of law prioritized |
| Skepticism | About technocratic solutions |

### On This Vault

| Application | Usage |
|-------------|-------|
| [[Institutions and Progress]] | The framework applied to all history |
| [[Great Divergence]] | Why Europe's institutions diverged |
| [[Argentina Economic History]] | Failed to build inclusive institutions |
| [[Australia Economic History]] | Built inclusive institutions; succeeded |
| Every comparison | Asks what A&R would ask |

## Follow-Up Work

### *The Narrow Corridor* (2019)

| Argument | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Problem | Liberty requires balance between state and society |
| Too weak state | No order, no development |
| Too strong state | Despotism |
| Narrow corridor | Where both are strong, checking each other |
| Historical rarity | Most societies fall outside the corridor |

## Key Quotes

> "Nations fail because their extractive economic institutions do not create the incentives needed for people to save, invest, and innovate."

> "Inclusive economic institutions... are those that allow and encourage participation by the great mass of people in economic activities that make best use of their talents and skills."

> "Countries differ in their economic success because of their different institutions, the rules influencing how the economy works, and the incentives that motivate people."
