# Taxation

Taxation—the extraction of resources by states from their subjects—is fundamental to political and economic history. States need revenue to fund armies, bureaucracies, and infrastructure; how they raise it shapes economic incentives, social structures, and political legitimacy. From ancient grain levies to modern income taxes, the history of taxation illuminates the relationship between states and economies.

### The Deeper Point

Taxation is the price of state capacity—and state capacity is the price of economic complexity. The societies that developed the most sophisticated tax systems (Persia's standardized tribute, Rome's provincial taxes, Song China's commercial levies, England's parliamentary taxation) were also those that provided the most reliable property rights, infrastructure, and legal enforcement. The causation runs both ways: states need revenue to provide public goods, but economic actors only tolerate taxation when they see returns. This bargain—taxation in exchange for services—is what distinguishes productive states from extractive ones. See [[Institutions and Progress]] for why this matters to the vault's central question.
