# Neoclassical Economics

The dominant framework for modern price theory. Neoclassical economics assumes institutions as given—the [[Institutional Economics|institutional economics]] tradition asks where those assumptions came from.

## The Marginal Revolution

### Origins (1870s)

| Thinker | Contribution |
|---------|--------------|
| William Stanley Jevons | Marginal utility theory (England) |
| Carl Menger | Subjective value theory (Austria) |
| Léon Walras | General equilibrium (Switzerland) |
| Alfred Marshall | Supply and demand synthesis (England) |

### What Changed

| Before (Classical) | After (Neoclassical) |
|--------------------|----------------------|
| Labor theory of value | Subjective utility |
| Class-based analysis | Individual optimization |
| Historical emphasis | Mathematical formalization |
| Production focus | Exchange focus |

## Core Concepts

### The Framework

| Concept | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| Marginal utility | Value of one more unit |
| Diminishing returns | Each additional unit worth less |
| Equilibrium | Supply equals demand |
| Rational actors | Maximize utility given constraints |
| Perfect information | Agents know prices and quality |
| Perfect competition | Many buyers/sellers, no market power |

### Price Theory

| Element | Role |
|---------|------|
| Supply curve | Quantity offered at each price |
| Demand curve | Quantity desired at each price |
| Market clearing | Price adjusts until they match |
| Efficiency | Resources flow to highest-value uses |

### Consumer Theory

| Concept | Application |
|---------|-------------|
| Budget constraint | Income limits choices |
| Indifference curves | Preference mapping |
| Optimization | Best bundle given constraint |
| Substitution effect | Price changes shift choices |

## Mathematical Formalization

### General Equilibrium (Walras)

| Feature | Significance |
|---------|--------------|
| All markets simultaneously | Prices interconnected |
| Existence proof | Arrow-Debreu (1954) |
| Welfare theorems | Efficiency of competition |
| Assumptions | Strong, often unrealistic |

### Extensions

| Development | Contribution |
|-------------|--------------|
| Game theory | Strategic interaction |
| Information economics | Asymmetric knowledge |
| Contract theory | Incentive design |
| Mechanism design | Institution engineering |

## Influence on Policy

### Applications

| Domain | Neoclassical Approach |
|--------|----------------------|
| Antitrust | Market power, deadweight loss |
| Trade | Comparative advantage, gains from trade |
| Finance | Efficient markets hypothesis |
| Labor | Marginal productivity, wages |
| Environment | Externalities, Pigovian taxes |

### Policy Implications

| Principle | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| Markets efficient | Minimize intervention |
| Prices carry information | Let prices adjust freely |
| Competition good | Break up monopolies |
| Trade beneficial | Remove barriers |

## Critiques and Limits

### Behavioral Challenges

| Anomaly | Problem |
|---------|---------|
| Loss aversion | Losses hurt more than gains help |
| Framing effects | Presentation changes choices |
| Bounded rationality | Limited information processing |
| Herding | Follow the crowd |

### Institutional Blindspots

| Gap | Consequence |
|-----|-------------|
| Institutions as given | Doesn't explain where markets come from |
| Transaction costs ignored | Firms unexplained |
| Power absent | Distribution unexplained |
| History irrelevant | Path dependence missed |

### Financial Crisis Challenge

| Assumption | 2008 Reality |
|------------|--------------|
| Efficient markets | Bubbles, crashes |
| Rational expectations | Panic, herding |
| Self-correcting | Required intervention |
| Risk diversifiable | Systemic risk |

## Relationship to Other Schools

### Versus Keynesian

| Neoclassical | Keynesian |
|--------------|-----------|
| Markets self-correct | Can get stuck |
| Supply creates demand | Demand can fall short |
| Flexible prices | Sticky prices |
| Long-run focus | Short-run matters |

### Versus Austrian

| Neoclassical | Austrian |
|--------------|----------|
| Equilibrium analysis | Disequilibrium process |
| Mathematical models | Verbal reasoning |
| Static optimization | Dynamic discovery |
| Central planning possible | Knowledge problem |

### Versus Institutional

| Neoclassical | Institutional |
|--------------|---------------|
| Institutions given | Institutions explained |
| Transaction costs zero | Transaction costs central |
| History irrelevant | Path dependence |
| Universal models | Context matters |

## The New Synthesis

### Incorporating Critiques

| Development | Integration |
|-------------|-------------|
| Behavioral economics | Modified optimization |
| New institutional economics | Transaction costs, property rights |
| Information economics | Asymmetry, signaling |
| Complexity economics | Emergence, non-equilibrium |

### Contemporary Status

| Strength | Weakness |
|----------|----------|
| Powerful toolkit | Strong assumptions |
| Predictive in some domains | Failed in financial crisis |
| Foundation for extensions | Ignores power and institutions |
| Policy-applicable | Distribution blind |

## The Deeper Point

Neoclassical economics assumes [[Institutions and Progress|institutions]] as given—property rights exist, contracts are enforced, information flows freely, transactions are costless. The [[Institutional Economics|institutional economics]] tradition asks where those assumptions came from. When property rights are insecure, when contracts can't be enforced, when information is asymmetric—markets don't work as neoclassical theory predicts. The gap between the neoclassical ideal and reality is precisely where institutions matter. Understanding why markets work in some contexts and fail in others requires understanding the institutional infrastructure that neoclassical economics takes for granted. The vault's thesis—that institutions channel ambition into production or extraction—addresses exactly the question neoclassical economics doesn't ask: what makes markets possible in the first place?
