# Colonialism

Colonialism was the extension of European power over most of the world—reshaping economies, societies, and political boundaries from the Americas to Africa to Asia. For five centuries, colonial systems extracted resources, restructured labor, and integrated distant regions into European-centered markets. The economic legacy of colonialism remains visible in patterns of trade, inequality, and development today.
