# Labor History

Labor history examines how humans have worked across time—the conditions, organization, compensation, and meaning of work. From unfree labor in ancient civilizations to modern gig work, the forms of labor have constantly evolved. The struggle between workers and employers over wages, conditions, and power shapes economic history. Understanding labor means understanding how surplus was extracted, how workers resisted, and how work itself was transformed.
