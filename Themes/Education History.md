# Education History

Education—the systematic transmission of knowledge and skills—has shaped economic development and social mobility throughout history. From Sumerian scribal schools to modern universities, educational institutions trained the administrators, merchants, and professionals who managed complex economies. Who received education, what was taught, and how it was organized reveal much about societies' values and economic needs.
