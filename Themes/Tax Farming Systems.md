# Tax Farming Systems

Why use intermediaries for extraction? Tax farming reveals state capacity constraints—where states couldn't administer directly, they contracted out, with varying results. Roman publicani, Ottoman iltizam, French fermiers généraux—each delegated collection to private parties who kept the difference between their bid and actual collections. When did tax farming work versus fail?

## Roman Publicani

### Republican System

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Organization | Societates publicanorum (companies) |
| Contract | Auctioned to highest bidder |
| Scope | Provincial taxes, customs, public works |
| Profit | Difference between bid and collection |
| Risk | Bore losses if undercollected |

### How It Worked

| Stage | Process |
|-------|---------|
| Auction | Companies bid for contracts |
| Advance | Paid lump sum to treasury |
| Collection | Publicani extracted from province |
| Margin | Everything above bid = profit |
| Enforcement | Private force, some oversight |

### Who Were Publicani?

| Class | Role |
|-------|------|
| Equestrians | Wealthy, commercial |
| Senators | Formally excluded, silent partners |
| Mancipes | Lead contractors |
| Shareholders | Investors in societates |

### Problems

| Issue | Consequence |
|-------|-------------|
| Extraction incentive | Collected as much as possible |
| Provincial abuse | Resentment, rebellion |
| Political power | Equestrians challenged senators |
| Corruption | Officials bribed or co-opted |
| Cicero's dilemma | "If we restrain them, we lose allies; if we allow them, we lose subjects" |

### Imperial Transition

| Change | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Augustus | Reduced publicani role |
| Procurators | Imperial officials collected |
| Direct taxes | State administered |
| Customs | Some contracting remained |
| Outcome | More direct control |

## Islamic Iltizam

### Ottoman System

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Contract | Multazim (tax farmer) wins bid |
| Scope | Revenue of assigned area |
| Duration | Initially short, later lifelong |
| Payment | Lump sum to treasury |
| Profit | Excess over payment |

### Evolution

| Period | Character |
|--------|-----------|
| Classical | Short-term, rotated |
| 17th century | Longer terms, heritable |
| Malikane (1695) | Lifetime grants |
| 19th century | Reforms attempted |

### Why Ottomans Used Tax Farming

| Reason | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| Administrative limits | Couldn't collect directly |
| Cash needs | Immediate payment |
| Local knowledge | Farmers knew terrain |
| Military focus | State capacity for war |

### Consequences

| Effect | Outcome |
|--------|---------|
| Extraction | Variable, often excessive |
| Investment | Some farmers improved land |
| Local power | Tax farmers became notables |
| State capacity | Didn't develop alternative |
| Decline | Contributed to fiscal weakness |

## French Fermiers Généraux

### Old Regime System

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Ferme Générale | Company of tax farmers |
| Taxes | Gabelle (salt), aides (excise), customs |
| Farmers | 40 wealthy individuals |
| Lease | Multi-year contracts |
| Profits | Substantial, often resented |

### How It Worked

| Element | Function |
|---------|----------|
| Consortium | Farmers pooled capital |
| Advance | Paid crown, borrowed rest |
| Collection | Thousands of employees |
| Enforcement | Private army of guards |
| Profit | Difference, often 10%+ |

### Who Became Farmers?

| Background | Pathway |
|------------|---------|
| Financiers | Capital, credit access |
| Nobles | Purchased positions |
| Networks | Personal connections |
| Marriages | United financial families |

### Problems and Reform

| Problem | Attempt |
|---------|---------|
| Public hatred | Revolution's target |
| Inefficiency | Multiple intermediaries |
| Extraction | Notorious for abuse |
| Reform | Various failed attempts |
| End | Abolished 1790, farmers executed |

## Chinese Variations

### Salt Merchants

| System | Features |
|--------|----------|
| Monopoly | State controlled salt |
| Merchants | Purchased selling rights |
| Regions | Assigned territories |
| Revenue | Major income source |
| Corruption | Endemic in system |

### Comparison With West

| Dimension | China | Rome/France |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| Scope | Specific commodities | Broader taxation |
| State role | More direct oversight | More delegation |
| Bureaucracy | Stronger | Weaker |
| Outcome | Hybrid system | Full tax farming |

## When Did Tax Farming Work?

### Success Conditions

| Condition | Mechanism |
|-----------|-----------|
| Competition | Bidding reduced rents |
| Oversight | State monitored farmers |
| Short terms | Farmers couldn't entrench |
| Investment | Farmers improved collection |
| State capacity | Could reclaim if needed |

### Failure Conditions

| Condition | Result |
|-----------|--------|
| Monopoly | Farmers extract maximally |
| Long terms | Power accumulates |
| Weak oversight | Abuse uncontrolled |
| Political capture | Farmers control state |
| No alternative | State can't resume collection |

## Comparative Assessment

| System | Efficiency | Fairness | State Capacity |
|--------|------------|----------|----------------|
| Roman publicani | Medium | Low | Didn't build |
| Ottoman iltizam | Low | Low | Declined |
| French ferme | Medium | Low | Didn't build |
| Chinese | Medium | Medium | Maintained |
| Direct collection | Higher | Variable | Built |

## The Deeper Point

Tax farming reveals [[State Capacity|state capacity]] constraints—where states couldn't administer directly, they contracted out, with varying results. [[Roman Republic|Roman publicani]] generated revenue but extracted so excessively that provinces rebelled. [[Ottoman Economic Institutions|Ottoman iltizam]] initially served fiscal needs but became entrenched, preventing bureaucratic development. [[French Revolution|French fermiers généraux]] were so hated they were guillotined. The common pattern: tax farming is a shortcut that trades long-term capacity for short-term revenue. States that used tax farming got immediate cash but didn't build administrative infrastructure. States that developed direct collection—Chinese bureaucracy, British revenue service—built capacity that enabled larger states. The [[Fiscal State Emergence|transition to modern fiscal states]] required abandoning tax farming for direct administration. This was politically difficult (farmers resisted) and administratively demanding (required trained officials). Where it happened—England, Prussia, eventually France—states became capable of sustained extraction without destruction. [[Institutions and Progress|Institutional development]] often requires abandoning shortcuts that work in the short term but prevent building better systems.
