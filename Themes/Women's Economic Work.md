# Women's Economic Work

Women have always worked—economic history systematically undercounts their contributions. Spinning, brewing, childcare, food production, retail, textile work: economic activities essential to every society, often invisible in records because performed in households, classified as "domestic," or excluded from official statistics. The story of women's economic work is one of changing constraints: what work was available, what was permitted, what was counted. Institutions shaped opportunities, and women navigated institutional constraints with agency and adaptation.

## Overview

| Era | Dominant pattern |
|-----|------------------|
| Agricultural | Field labor + household production |
| Medieval urban | Craft assistance, some guilds, retail |
| Proto-industrial | Spinning, putting-out work |
| Industrial | Factory work, domestic service |
| Modern | Service, professional, care work |

## Ancient and Medieval

### Agricultural Work

| Activity | Character |
|----------|-----------|
| Field labor | Planting, weeding, harvesting |
| Animal husbandry | Dairy, poultry |
| Food processing | Grinding, preserving, cooking |
| Textile | Spinning (near-universal) |
| Household | Childcare, maintenance, production |

### Urban Work

| Activity | Access |
|----------|--------|
| Spinning | Open, low-status |
| Weaving | Sometimes guild-restricted |
| Brewing/baking | Sometimes guild-controlled |
| Retail | Market selling, small shops |
| Domestic service | Major employment |

### [[Guild Economics|Guild]] Position

| Pattern | Examples |
|---------|----------|
| Excluded | Most crafts |
| Widows | Could continue husband's trade |
| All-female guilds | Silk (Paris), some textiles |
| Family labor | Assisting in household craft |
| Declining access | 13th-16th c. trend toward exclusion |

## Spinning: The Universal Women's Work

### Centrality

| Fact | Significance |
|------|--------------|
| Pre-industrial | Every household spun |
| Gender | Almost exclusively female |
| Time | Enormous hours required |
| Skill | Real but undervalued |
| Language | "Spinster" = unmarried woman |

### Economics

| Aspect | Character |
|--------|-----------|
| Productivity | Much slower than weaving |
| Bottleneck | Limited textile output |
| Wages | Low, piece-rate |
| Necessity | Required before any weaving |
| Transformation | Spinning jenny made obsolete |

## Proto-Industrialization

### Putting-Out System

| Feature | Character |
|---------|-----------|
| Organization | Merchant provides materials |
| Location | Rural households |
| Labor | Family, especially women |
| Products | Textiles mainly |
| Wages | Piece rates |

### Women's Role

| Pattern | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Spinning | Primary activity |
| Preparation | Carding, preparation |
| Some weaving | Supplementary |
| Family economy | Essential contribution |
| Flexibility | Combined with childcare |

### Geographic Patterns

| Region | Character |
|--------|-----------|
| England | Lancashire cotton |
| Flanders | Linen |
| Switzerland | Watch parts |
| Germany | Textiles, metal goods |

## Industrial Revolution

### Factory Work

| Sector | Women's role |
|--------|--------------|
| Cotton mills | Large female workforce |
| Pottery | Decoration, finishing |
| Match-making | Dangerous, low-paid |
| Clothing | Sewing, assembly |

### Conditions

| Aspect | Character |
|--------|-----------|
| Wages | Lower than men's (50-60%) |
| Hours | 12-16 hour days |
| Discipline | Factory rules |
| Health | Often dangerous |
| Supervision | Male overseers |

### Domestic Service

| Fact | Significance |
|------|--------------|
| Largest employer | Of women, 19th c. |
| Live-in | Part of employer household |
| Hours | Unlimited availability |
| Status | Low but "respectable" |
| Alternative | To factory or marriage |

## Marriage and Property

### Coverture

| Principle | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| Legal doctrine | Wife's legal identity merged with husband |
| Property | Husband controlled |
| Earnings | Husband's property |
| Contracts | Wife couldn't make |
| Gradual reform | 19th-20th century |

### Married Women's Property Acts

| Country | Date | Effect |
|---------|------|--------|
| UK | 1870, 1882 | Women keep earnings |
| US | Various, 1839-1895 | State by state |
| France | 1907 | Control of earnings |

### Economic Implications

| Before reform | After reform |
|---------------|--------------|
| No property rights | Own earnings |
| Dependent on husband | Some independence |
| Limited credit | Could borrow |
| Business impossible | Could own businesses |

## 20th Century Transformation

### War Work

| War | Effect |
|-----|--------|
| WWI | Women into industry |
| WWII | "Rosie the Riveter" |
| Post-war | Often pushed out |
| Long-term | Demonstrated capability |

### Service Economy

| Sector | Women's presence |
|--------|------------------|
| Clerical | Majority from 1920s |
| Retail | Long tradition |
| Healthcare | Nursing, care work |
| Education | Teaching |
| Food service | Waitressing, food prep |

### Professional Entry

| Barrier | Timing of fall |
|---------|----------------|
| Higher education | Late 19th-20th c. |
| Law | 20th century |
| Medicine | 20th century |
| Business | Ongoing |
| Glass ceiling | Persists |

## Care Work

### The Invisible Economy

| Activity | Character |
|----------|-----------|
| Childcare | Unpaid, essential |
| Elder care | Unpaid, growing |
| Household | Cooking, cleaning |
| Emotional labor | Support, management |
| Economic value | Not counted in GDP |

### Market vs. Household

| Paradox | Explanation |
|---------|-------------|
| If paid | Counts as GDP |
| If unpaid | Invisible |
| Same activity | Different accounting |
| Implication | Women's work undercounted |

## The Deeper Point

Women's economic work reveals that [[Institutions and Progress|institutions]] shape not just production but whose production counts. Spinning was economically essential—without spinners, no cloth—yet spinners were poorly paid and socially invisible. Coverture meant married women's earnings belonged to husbands, removing economic incentive and legal recognition. [[Guild Economics|Guilds]] often excluded women from crafts they'd practiced, channeling them into low-wage work. The pattern persists: care work essential to society remains unpaid or underpaid because institutions don't value it. Yet women have always exercised agency within constraints: widows ran businesses, proto-industrial families organized around women's spinning, professional women broke barriers one by one. The history of women's work is not separate from economic history—it's the often-invisible half of it. Progress has meant both expanding opportunities (professional access, property rights) and making invisible work visible (GDP accounting debates, care work recognition). The institutional constraints that shaped women's work are changing, but slowly, and the legacy of undervaluation persists.
