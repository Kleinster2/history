# Agrarian Systems

Land is the original form of wealth, and land tenure systems are the original form of economic institution. How land is owned, worked, and transferred determines not just agricultural productivity but the entire structure of rural society—and through it, the possibilities for industrialization and development. The contrast between East Asian land reform (which created productive smallholders) and Latin American latifundia (which perpetuated inequality) is one of the clearest demonstrations of how [[Institutions and Progress|institutional]] choices channel economic outcomes. Land systems persist for centuries; breaking them requires political revolution or external intervention.

## Overview

### Why Land Systems Matter

| Dimension | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| Productivity | Incentives to invest, improve |
| Inequality | Wealth and power distribution |
| Politics | Who has voice, who is excluded |
| Labor | Free, coerced, or wage |
| Development path | Demand, savings, human capital |

### Major Land Systems

| System | Character | Where |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| Smallholder | Family farms, owner-operated | Japan, Korea, Taiwan |
| Latifundia | Large estates, tenant/wage labor | Latin America, Southern Europe |
| Feudal | Lord-peasant, service obligations | Medieval Europe, Japan |
| Communal | Village-owned, allocated | Africa, pre-colonial |
| Collective | State-owned, collectively worked | Soviet, Maoist |
| Plantation | Commercial monoculture, coerced labor | Caribbean, Southeast Asia |

## Colonial Land Systems

### Latin American Patterns

| System | Description | Legacy |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| Encomienda | Labor rights over indigenous | Exploitation basis |
| Hacienda | Large estates, tied labor | Rural inequality |
| Latifundia | Giant landholdings | Persisted to 20th c. |
| Minifundia | Tiny plots, fragmented | Insufficient for subsistence |

### Asian Colonial Systems

| Colony | System | Effect |
|--------|--------|--------|
| India (zamindari) | Tax farmers became owners | Created landlord class |
| India (ryotwari) | Peasant directly taxed | Some ownership, heavy burden |
| Indonesia (cultuurstelsel) | Forced cultivation | Export crops, impoverishment |
| Philippines | Hacienda model | Similar to Latin America |

### African Colonial Systems

| Pattern | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Settler colonies | White ownership, African labor |
| Reserves | Africans confined, land restricted |
| Plantation zones | Commercial, coerced labor |
| Preservation of chiefs | Indirect rule through traditional |

## Land Reform: Success Cases

### Japan (1946-1950)

| Feature | Result |
|---------|--------|
| Context | US occupation, MacArthur |
| Scope | 80% of tenant land transferred |
| Method | Compensated redistribution |
| Outcome | Owner-cultivator majority |
| Effect | Rural demand, equality, LDP support |

### Taiwan (1949-1953)

| Feature | Result |
|---------|--------|
| Context | KMT retreat, land for legitimacy |
| Rent reduction | 37.5% maximum |
| Land to tiller | Redistribution with bonds |
| Outcome | Small farm economy |
| Effect | Basis for industrial development |

### South Korea (1948-1950)

| Feature | Result |
|---------|--------|
| Context | Post-Japanese, pre-war |
| Japanese land | Distributed to tenants |
| Korean landlords | Expropriated with compensation |
| Outcome | Relatively equal farms |
| Effect | Enabled export-led growth |

### Common Factors in Success

| Factor | Importance |
|--------|------------|
| External pressure | Occupation or threat |
| Elite break | Old landlords destroyed or displaced |
| State capacity | Could implement |
| Political will | Reform government committed |
| Compensation | Made it possible |

## Land Reform: Failure Cases

### Latin America

| Country | Attempt | Outcome |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Mexico (1910s-30s) | Revolutionary ejido | Partial, collective not individual |
| Bolivia (1952) | MNR reform | Minifundia, productivity fell |
| Chile (1960s-70s) | Allende, then reversed | Pinochet returned land |
| Brazil | Never comprehensive | MST movement continues |
| Guatemala (1952) | Arbenz reform | CIA coup reversed it |

### Why Latin America Failed

| Factor | Problem |
|--------|---------|
| Elite power | Landlords blocked or reversed |
| Weak states | Couldn't implement |
| US opposition | Cold War, feared communism |
| Incomplete | Left minifundia problem |
| No complementary policy | Credit, extension, markets absent |

### Africa

| Pattern | Problem |
|---------|---------|
| Zimbabwe | Chaotic, political, productivity collapsed |
| South Africa | Slow, market-based, incomplete |
| Kenya | Some success, ethnic complications |
| General | Communal tenure complicates reform |

### Communist Land Reform

| Country | Method | Outcome |
|---------|--------|---------|
| Soviet Union | Collectivization | Famine, productivity collapse |
| China (Mao) | Collectivization | Great Leap famine |
| China (Deng) | Household responsibility | Productivity surge |
| Cuba | State farms | Persistent shortage |
| Vietnam | Decollectivization | Growth resumed |

## Land and Inequality

### The Engerman-Sokoloff Thesis

| Premise | Argument |
|---------|----------|
| Factor endowments | Determined colonial land systems |
| Tropical + slaves | → Plantation → inequality |
| Temperate + settlers | → Smallholder → equality |
| Persistence | Inequality locked in institutions |
| Legacy | Explains Americas divergence |

### Transmission Mechanisms

| Channel | How It Works |
|--------|--------------|
| Education | Elites oppose mass schooling |
| Political power | Land = votes = policy |
| Credit access | Collateral determines borrowing |
| Investment | Landlords extract, don't invest |
| Migration | Landless leave for cities |

### Breaking the Cycle

| Intervention | Effect |
|--------------|--------|
| Land reform | Redistribution of assets |
| Education | Human capital independent of land |
| Industrialization | Alternative to agriculture |
| Migration | Exit option |
| Democracy | Political voice for landless |

## Modern Agrarian Issues

### Agribusiness and Consolidation

| Trend | Pattern |
|-------|---------|
| Farm size | Growing in developed world |
| Corporate ownership | Increasing |
| Contract farming | Quasi-integration |
| Vertical integration | Seed to supermarket |
| Family farm decline | Across rich countries |

### Land Grabs

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Scale | Millions of hectares since 2008 |
| Where | Africa, Southeast Asia, Latin America |
| Buyers | Gulf states, China, investment funds |
| Purpose | Food security, speculation, biofuels |
| Concerns | Displacement, food security, rights |

### Land Rights and Development

| Issue | Debate |
|-------|--------|
| Titling | De Soto thesis: formalize for credit |
| Customary tenure | Works well in some contexts |
| Women's land rights | Often excluded, productivity loss |
| Commons | Tragedy or sustainable management? |

## The Deeper Point

Land systems are [[Institutions and Progress|institutional]] in the deepest sense: they determine who has assets, who has power, and where [[Entrepreneurship|ambition]] flows. The contrast between East Asia (where land reform created a broad-based rural middle class that demanded education, saved for investment, and provided markets for industry) and Latin America (where haciendas perpetuated a class of landless laborers with no stake in development) is one of history's clearest natural experiments. Same global economy, same development aspirations, radically different outcomes—because land institutions channeled rural ambition differently. In Korea, the farmer's son could become an engineer; in Guatemala, he became a migrant or a revolutionary. The [[Reversal of Fortune]] thesis emphasizes colonial institutions; land systems are those institutions made concrete. Land reform worked where external shocks (war, occupation) broke landlord power; it failed where elites retained control or where states lacked capacity to implement. The lesson for [[Development Economics]]: you cannot industrialize successfully on a foundation of extreme rural inequality—the demand isn't there, the savings aren't there, and the politics of exclusion poison everything else. [[Property Rights]] matter, but *whose* property rights matter just as much.
