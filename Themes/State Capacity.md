# State Capacity

State capacity—the ability to implement policy decisions, collect revenue, enforce law, and provide public goods—is the missing variable in naive institutional economics. Writing good laws is easy; making them real is hard. The distinction between states that *can* implement and those that *can't* explains more about economic outcomes than any formal institutional difference. A constitution that guarantees [[Property Rights|property rights]] means nothing if the courts can't enforce it, the police can be bribed, and the land registry doesn't exist.

## Overview

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Definition | Ability to implement policy decisions |
| Distinct from | Regime type (democracy/autocracy) |
| Distinct from | State size (big government ≠ capable government) |
| Components | Fiscal, legal, administrative, coercive |
| Key insight | Good institutions require capable states |

## Dimensions of State Capacity

### Fiscal Capacity

|-----------|---------|
| Rule of law | Consistent enforcement |
| Contract enforcement | Speed, cost, predictability |
| Property registration | Coverage, accuracy |
| Dispute resolution | Courts accessible, fair |
| Regulation | Implementation, not just legislation |

### Administrative Capacity

## State Capacity Through History

### Ancient States

| State | Capacity Level | Evidence |
|-------|---------------|----------|
| [[Ancient Egypt]] | High | Census, corvée, monumental building |
| [[Mesopotamia]] | Moderate | Tax records, law codes |
| [[Achaemenid Empire\|Persia]] | High | Satrapy system, Royal Road |
| [[Roman Empire]] | High then declining | Census, roads, legions |
| [[Ancient China\|Qin/Han China]] | Very high | Registration, standardization |

### Medieval States

| State | Capacity Level | Character |
|-------|---------------|-----------|
| [[Byzantine Empire]] | High (declining) | Bureaucratic tradition |
| [[Abbasid Caliphate]] | High then fragmented | Early Islamic administration |
| Song China | Very high | Examination system, tax census |
| Medieval Europe | Low | Feudal fragmentation |
| [[Mongol Empire]] | High (extraction) | Census, postal system |

### Early Modern

| State | Capacity Level | Innovation |
|-------|---------------|-----------|
| [[Ming Dynasty\|Ming China]] | High | Registration, granaries |
| [[Ottoman Empire]] | High (then declining) | Timar system, surveys |
| Spain | Moderate (colonial) | New World administration |
| France | Rising | Intendants, centralization |
| England | Rising | Parliament-backed taxation |

### Modern

| State | Capacity Level | Character |
|-------|---------------|-----------|
| Britain (19th c.) | High | Census, police, civil service |
| Prussia/Germany | Very high | Bureaucracy, education |
| [[Meiji Restoration\|Meiji Japan]] | Rapidly built | Imported + adapted |
| [[Asian Tigers]] | Very high | Developmental state |
| Post-colonial Africa | Generally low | Inherited borders, not capacity |

## The Capacity-Development Nexus

### Why Capacity Matters for Growth

| Mechanism | Logic |
|-----------|-------|
| Property rights | Must be *enforced*, not just written |
| Contracts | Must be *adjudicated* |
| Infrastructure | Must be *built and maintained* |
| Education | Must be *delivered* |
| Market regulation | Must be *implemented* |
| Tax collection | Must *fund* all the above |

### High Capacity + Inclusive Institutions

| Example | Result |
|---------|--------|
| Industrial Britain | Sustained growth |
| Post-WWII Western Europe | [[European Economic Miracle]] |
| [[Asian Tigers]] | Rapid catch-up |
| Scandinavia | High growth + equality |

### High Capacity + Extractive Institutions

| Example | Result |
|---------|--------|
| [[Soviet Economy]] | Rapid industrialization, then stagnation |
| [[Spanish Empire Economy\|Spanish Empire]] | Extraction, not development |
| Colonial regimes | Extraction machinery |
| Modern China (partial) | Growth with repression |

### Low Capacity (Any Institutions)

| Example | Result |
|---------|--------|
| Post-colonial Africa (general) | Formal institutions meaningless |
| Failed states | Somalia, Libya |
| Weak enforcement | Rule of law on paper only |
| Result | Good constitutions, bad outcomes |

## Building State Capacity

### Historical Paths

| Path | Examples |
|------|---------|
| War-making | European states (Tilly: "war made the state") |
| Colonial inheritance | India, Singapore |
| Revolution | China, France |
| Deliberate construction | [[Meiji Restoration\|Meiji Japan]], [[Asian Tigers\|Korea/Taiwan]] |
| Gradual accumulation | Britain, Netherlands |

### Tilly's Thesis: War Made the State

| Logic | Mechanism |
|-------|-----------|
| War requires revenue | Taxation builds fiscal capacity |
| Revenue requires consent | Bargaining builds representation |
| Military needs | Drive bureaucratization |
| Competition | Weak states conquered |
| European result | Fiscal-military states |

### Why Some States Failed to Build Capacity

| Factor | Mechanism |
|--------|-----------|
| Colonial extraction | Built capacity for extraction, not service |
| Aid dependence | Revenue without taxation → no bargain |
| Resource curse | Oil revenue → no need for broad taxation |
| Ethnic fragmentation | Trust deficit → weak compliance |
| Elite capture | State serves narrow interests |

## The Paradox of State Capacity

### The Circular Problem

| Step | Logic |
|------|-------|
| Good institutions require enforcement | Need state capacity |
| State capacity is itself institutional | Need good institutions to build it |
| How to start? | The development chicken-and-egg |
| Historical answers | War, external threat, visionary leaders, colonial inheritance |

### Capacity Without Accountability

| Risk | Example |
|------|---------|
| Predatory state | Extractive capacity without constraint |
| Surveillance state | Monitoring without rights |
| Efficient repression | China's social credit |
| Lesson | Capacity + accountability = development |
| | Capacity alone = sophisticated extraction |

### The Goldilocks Problem

| Too Little | Just Right | Too Much |
|------------|------------|----------|
| Can't enforce laws | Implements effectively | Suffocates initiative |
| Can't provide services | Delivers public goods | Crowds out private action |
| Can't collect taxes | Funds development | Extracts excessively |
| Chaos | Growth | Stagnation or oppression |

## Measuring State Capacity

### Indicators

| Measure | What It Shows |
|---------|---------------|
| Tax/GDP ratio | Fiscal capacity |
| Government effectiveness index | Administrative quality |
| Rule of law index | Legal enforcement |
| Census coverage | Information capacity |
| Infrastructure quality | Implementation |

### Rankings (Approximate, 2020s)

| Tier | Examples |
|------|---------|
| Very high | Denmark, Singapore, Japan, Germany |
| High | US, UK, France, South Korea |
| Moderate | Brazil, India, Turkey, South Africa |
| Low | Nigeria, Pakistan, Bangladesh |
| Very low | Somalia, Yemen, South Sudan |

## State Capacity and Economic Theories

### Institutionalist View (North, Acemoglu)

| Claim | Nuance |
|-------|--------|
| Institutions determine outcomes | But institutions require enforcement capacity |
| Inclusive vs. extractive | Both require state capacity |
| Missing variable | *Implementation* capacity assumed |

### Developmental State Literature

| Thinker | Argument |
|---------|----------|
| Chalmers Johnson | MITI and Japanese miracle—bureaucratic competence |
| Peter Evans | "Embedded autonomy"—connected but independent |
| Ha-Joon Chang | "Kicking away the ladder"—capacity before liberalization |
| Lesson | Capable bureaucracy can direct development |

### Public Choice / Libertarian View

| Claim | Counter |
|-------|---------|
| State capacity = rent-seeking opportunity | But low capacity = different rent-seeking |
| Minimal state best | Minimal states historically poor |
| Market solves | Markets require state-enforced rules |
| Tension | States can both enable and obstruct |

---

## The Deeper Point

State capacity is the missing variable in naive institutional economics—the reason why identical constitutions produce wildly different outcomes in different countries, and why "just adopt good institutions" is useless advice for developing nations. The institutional thesis ([[Institutions and Progress]]) is correct that rules channeling ambition into production matter more than geography or culture. But it assumes a capable entity to *enforce* those rules—and building that entity is itself the hardest institutional challenge. The [[Asian Tigers]] didn't succeed because they had better formal institutions than sub-Saharan Africa; they succeeded because they had inherited (from Japanese colonialism and subsequent authoritarian development) bureaucratic *capacity* to implement industrial policy, enforce contracts, deliver education, and collect taxes. [[Meiji Restoration|Meiji Japan]] didn't succeed by adopting Western institutions wholesale; it succeeded by building an administrative apparatus *capable* of implementing whatever institutions it chose. The development problem is circular: good institutions require state capacity to enforce them, but state capacity is itself an institutional achievement. Breaking this circle has historically required some combination of external threat (Tilly's wars), inherited infrastructure (colonial administrative legacy), or extraordinary political will (developmental authoritarianism). No poor country has built high state capacity through democratic deliberation alone—which is the uncomfortable truth that the institutional optimists prefer not to discuss. [[Property Rights]] on paper are worthless without registries, courts, police, and bureaucrats capable of making them real.
