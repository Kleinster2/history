# Economic Convergence

If the ancient world produced multiple viable economic systems—markets and redistribution, money and moneylessness, slavery and mit'a—why did the modern world converge on a single model? The answer involves conquest, contingency, and path dependence more than any inherent superiority of one system over others.

## The Puzzle

### What Existed (Ancient World)

| System | Example | Viability |
|--------|---------|-----------|
| Market + money | Greece, Rome | Worked |
| State redistribution | Egypt, Inca | Worked |
| Standardization without rulers | Indus Valley | Worked |
| State + market hybrid | China | Worked |
| No money, no markets | Inca | Worked |
| Tribute empire | Persia | Worked |

### What Exists Now

| System | Coverage |
|--------|----------|
| Market economy | Near-universal |
| Money | Universal |
| Private property | Near-universal |
| Wage labor | Dominant |
| Capitalism | Global (with variations) |

### The Question

**If multiple systems worked, why did one system become universal?**

---

## Three Explanations

### 1. Superiority Theory

**Claim:** Markets/money/capitalism won because they're more efficient.

| Argument | Problem |
|----------|---------|
| Markets allocate better | Inca allocated without markets for 100 years |
| Money enables trade | Trade existed without money |
| Capitalism grows faster | Growth wasn't always the goal |
| Competition selected best | Conquest isn't the same as competition |

**Verdict:** Partial truth, but doesn't explain why alternatives lasted so long or required conquest to end.

### 2. Conquest Theory

**Claim:** One system became universal through military conquest, not economic competition.

| Event | System Destroyed |
|-------|------------------|
| Spanish conquest (1533) | Inca redistribution |
| Spanish conquest (1521) | Aztec markets (replaced with colonial) |
| British colonialism | Indian textile economy |
| European colonialism | African systems |
| Gunboat diplomacy | Qing China forced open |

**Evidence:**
| System | How It Ended |
|--------|--------------|
| Inca | Conquered by Spain |
| Aztec | Conquered by Spain |
| Traditional China | Forced open by Opium Wars |
| Traditional Japan | Forced open by Perry |
| Pre-colonial Africa | Colonized |
| Pre-colonial India | Colonized |

**Verdict:** Strong explanation—most alternatives ended through violence, not competition.

### 3. Path Dependence Theory

**Claim:** Early advantages compounded; history locked in certain paths.

| Early Advantage | Compounding Effect |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| Eurasian geography | More domesticates, technology spread |
| Atlantic position | Americas access |
| Coal location | Industrial Revolution |
| Military technology | Conquest capability |
| First-mover | Standards became global |

**Verdict:** Explains why Europe specifically, but not why market systems in general.

## The Actual History

### Phase 1: Multiple Systems Coexist (3000 BCE - 1500 CE)

| Period | Situation |
|--------|-----------|
| Ancient | Multiple independent systems |
| Classical | Rome, Han, Persia, etc. |
| Medieval | Islamic, Chinese, European, American |
| 1400 CE | Still multiple viable systems |

### Phase 2: European Expansion (1500-1900)

| Century | Development |
|---------|-------------|
| 16th | Americas conquered, Inca/Aztec destroyed |
| 17th | Colonial trading companies |
| 18th | Atlantic slave trade peak, India colonized |
| 19th | Africa partitioned, China forced open |

### Phase 3: Global Capitalism (1900-present)

| Event | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| WWI/WWII | European empires weakened |
| Decolonization | Political independence |
| Cold War | Capitalist vs. Communist |
| 1991 | Soviet collapse |
| Present | Market capitalism near-universal |

## What Conquest Destroyed

### The Inca Alternative

| Feature | Lost |
|---------|------|
| Economy without money | Never tried again at scale |
| Economy without markets | Replaced by colonial markets |
| Mit'a labor | Transformed into colonial exploitation |
| Redistribution | Replaced by extraction |
| Khipu records | Knowledge largely lost |

### The Chinese Alternative

| Feature | Transformed |
|---------|-------------|
| State-market balance | Forced toward Western model |
| Tribute system | Replaced by treaty ports |
| Self-sufficiency | Forced into global trade |
| Confucian economics | Marginalized |

### Other Losses

| System | Fate |
|--------|------|
| African economic systems | Disrupted by slave trade, colonialism |
| Indian textiles | Destroyed by British policy |
| Indigenous American | Devastated by disease, conquest |

## Was Convergence Inevitable?

### Arguments For Inevitability

| Argument | Reasoning |
|----------|-----------|
| Efficiency | Markets really are more efficient |
| Scale | Global trade requires standardization |
| Technology | Industrial economy needs markets |
| Competition | Non-market systems would lose |

### Arguments Against Inevitability

| Argument | Evidence |
|----------|----------|
| Contingent conquests | Inca fell to 168 Spaniards + disease |
| Geographic luck | Europe's position was accidental |
| Path dependence | Early leads compounded |
| Counterfactuals | China almost industrialized first |
| Ideology | Capitalism spread by force + belief |

### The Honest Answer

| Factor | Role |
|--------|------|
| Some efficiency advantages | Probably real |
| Massive historical contingency | Also real |
| Military conquest | Definitely real |
| We can't fully separate them | Honest uncertainty |

## What Remains of Alternatives

### Surviving Elements

| Element | Where |
|---------|-------|
| State economic intervention | China, Singapore, many |
| Reciprocity/gift economy | Within families, communities |
| Non-market allocation | Public goods, some healthcare |
| Alternative currencies | Local currencies, crypto |
| Cooperatives | Worker-owned enterprises |

### The Inca Ghost

| Modern Parallel | Inca Precedent |
|-----------------|----------------|
| Welfare state | Redistribution |
| National service | Mit'a |
| Strategic reserves | Qollqa storehouses |
| Universal basic income? | State provision |

---

## Implications

### For Understanding Economy

| Lesson | Implication |
|--------|-------------|
| Convergence wasn't natural | Required conquest |
| Alternatives were viable | Not inherently inferior |
| History matters | Path dependence is real |
| Current system is contingent | Could have been different |

### For the Future

| Question | Consideration |
|----------|---------------|
| Is current system permanent? | History suggests no |
| Are alternatives possible? | History says yes |
| What might change? | Technology, crisis, choice |
| What can we learn from alternatives? | Redistribution, non-market coordination |
