# Agricultural Technology Diffusion

Why did some regions adopt improvements while others didn't? Agricultural innovation diffused through institutional channels—where property rights were secure and farmers captured gains, they adopted; where not, they didn't. From the heavy plow to the Green Revolution, agricultural technology adoption has depended on whether institutions rewarded investment.

## Medieval Improvements

### Heavy Plow Adoption

| Innovation | Effect |
|------------|--------|
| Heavy plow | Could work heavy clay soils |
| Moldboard | Turned soil, improved drainage |
| Northern Europe | Enabled expansion |
| Light plow regions | Continued with older technology |

### Differential Adoption

| Region | Adoption | Why |
|--------|----------|-----|
| Northern Europe | Yes | Needed for clay soils |
| Mediterranean | Limited | Light soils, different needs |
| Eastern Europe | Slower | Institutional factors |

### Why Some Didn't Adopt

| Factor | Barrier |
|--------|---------|
| Communal fields | Couldn't experiment alone |
| Strip farming | Required coordination |
| Lord's demands | No surplus for investment |
| Lack of horses | Needed draught power |

### Three-Field Rotation

| Change | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Fallow reduction | 33% vs. 50% fallow |
| Productivity | ~50% more land in use |
| Adoption | Gradual, northern Europe |
| Barriers | Required community coordination |

## New World Crops

### Columbian Exchange Crops

| Crop | Origin | Spread To |
|------|--------|-----------|
| Potato | Americas | Europe, Asia |
| Maize | Americas | Africa, Europe |
| Sweet potato | Americas | Asia, Africa |
| Wheat | Old World | Americas |
| Rice | Asia | Americas |

### Differential Adoption

| Crop | Fast Adoption | Slow Adoption |
|------|---------------|---------------|
| Potato (Ireland) | Suited climate, land | Elite resistance elsewhere |
| Maize (Africa) | Adapted to conditions | Nutritional limits |
| Wheat (Americas) | European settlers | Indigenous communities |

### Why Varied Adoption?

| Factor | Fast | Slow |
|--------|------|------|
| Land tenure | Secure, can invest | Insecure |
| Markets | Access to sell | Subsistence only |
| Knowledge | Extension available | Isolated |
| Risk | Can survive failure | Too risky |

## British Agricultural Revolution

### Key Innovations

| Innovation | Effect |
|------------|--------|
| Enclosure | Consolidated holdings |
| Selective breeding | Better livestock |
| Four-field rotation | Eliminated fallow |
| Seed drills | More efficient planting |
| Turnips, clover | Fodder crops |

### Why Britain First?

| Factor | Mechanism |
|--------|-----------|
| Property rights | Secure after enclosure |
| Markets | London demand |
| Capital | Available for improvement |
| Labor | Could hire specialized |
| Knowledge | Agricultural societies spread ideas |

### Enclosure as Prerequisite

| Effect | Significance |
|--------|--------------|
| Consolidated holdings | Could experiment |
| Eliminated commons | Individual investment |
| Displaced peasants | Labor for industry |
| Controversy | Beneficial or extractive? |

### Continental Adoption

| Country | Timing | Barriers |
|---------|--------|----------|
| Netherlands | Early | Already advanced |
| France | Slower | Peasant holdings |
| Germany | Variable | East vs. West |
| Russia | Very slow | Serfdom blocked |

## Green Revolution

### Components

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| High-yield varieties | Dwarf wheat, rice |
| Irrigation | Water control |
| Fertilizers | Chemical inputs |
| Pesticides | Crop protection |
| Extension | Knowledge transfer |

### Where It Worked

| Region | Success |
|--------|---------|
| Punjab (India) | Major gains |
| Philippines | Rice yields doubled |
| Mexico | Wheat transformation |
| Parts of Africa | Limited impact |

### Where It Didn't

| Region | Barriers |
|--------|----------|
| Sub-Saharan Africa | Different crops, less irrigation |
| Dry regions | Water-dependent varieties |
| Small farmers | Couldn't afford inputs |

### Institutional Conditions for Adoption

| Requirement | Function |
|-------------|----------|
| Secure tenure | Farmers invest |
| Credit access | Buy inputs |
| Market access | Sell surplus |
| Extension services | Learn techniques |
| Infrastructure | Transport, irrigation |

## Why Adoption Varies

### Property Rights

| Tenure Type | Adoption Likelihood |
|-------------|---------------------|
| Freehold | High |
| Secure lease | Medium-high |
| Sharecropping | Medium (depends on terms) |
| Communal | Low (coordination problem) |
| Insecure | Low (why invest?) |

### Risk and Insurance

| Condition | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| Crop insurance | Enables experimentation |
| Diversified income | Can risk failure |
| Safety nets | Reduces risk |
| No backup | Conservative choices |

### Scale

| Farm Size | Adoption |
|-----------|----------|
| Large | Can afford experiments |
| Medium | Selective adoption |
| Small | Risk-averse, capital-poor |
| Collective | Variable |

## Patterns Across Time

### Common Barriers

| Barrier | Persistence |
|---------|-------------|
| Insecure tenure | All periods |
| Lack of capital | All periods |
| No markets | Reduces incentive |
| No knowledge | Limits awareness |
| Risk | Blocks experimentation |

### What Enables Diffusion

| Enabler | Mechanism |
|---------|-----------|
| Property security | Farmers capture gains |
| Credit | Can invest |
| Markets | Incentive to produce |
| Extension | Knowledge transfer |
| Infrastructure | Access and transport |

## The Deeper Point

Agricultural innovation diffused through [[Institutions and Progress|institutional channels]]—where [[Property Rights|property rights]] were secure and farmers captured gains, they adopted; where not, they didn't. The heavy plow spread where communal restrictions allowed experimentation. The British Agricultural Revolution required enclosure—controversial, but enabled investment. The [[Green Revolution]] succeeded where farmers had secure tenure, credit, and market access; it failed where these were absent. The pattern reveals that technology alone doesn't transform agriculture—institutional conditions determine adoption. A farmer with insecure tenure won't invest in improvements someone else might capture. A farmer without credit can't buy inputs. A farmer without market access has no reason to produce surplus. [[Development Economics|Agricultural development]] requires institutional infrastructure: property rights, credit systems, extension services, market access. Where these exist, farmers adopt new technologies quickly; where they don't, traditional methods persist. [[Technology Diffusion Failures|Technology diffusion is institutionally channeled]]—the same seeds produce different yields depending on whether farmers have incentives to use them optimally.
