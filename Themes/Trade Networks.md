# Trade Networks

Long-distance trade is as old as civilization itself. Networks of exchange moved goods, ideas, technologies, and diseases across continents, linking economies that never met. The great trade routes—Silk Road, Indian Ocean, trans-Saharan—were the arteries of pre-modern globalization, and their rise and fall shaped the trajectory of economic progress.

## Why Trade Matters

### What Trade Does

| Function | Effect |
|----------|--------|
| Moves goods | Resources reach where needed |
| Spreads technology | Innovations diffuse |
| Transmits ideas | Knowledge crosses borders |
| Integrates prices | Arbitrage reduces gaps |
| Creates wealth | Specialization benefits |

### The Gains from Trade

| Without Trade | With Trade |
|---------------|------------|
| Make everything locally | Specialize in advantage |
| Limited by local resources | Access global resources |
| Isolated knowledge | Shared innovations |
| Small markets | Large markets, scale economies |
