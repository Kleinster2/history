# Writing Systems

Writing—the graphic representation of language—was one of humanity's most consequential inventions. Developed independently in Mesopotamia, Egypt, China, and Mesoamerica, writing enabled record-keeping, administration, law, and the transmission of knowledge across time. Economic history is inseparable from writing: the earliest texts are accounting records, and complex economies required written contracts, laws, and bureaucratic records.
