# Environment & Economy

The relationship between environment and economy has been bidirectional throughout history: environmental conditions have shaped economic possibilities, while economic activities have transformed environments. From agricultural deforestation to industrial pollution to climate change, human economies have altered Earth's systems. Understanding this relationship is essential for addressing contemporary environmental challenges.
