# Insurance Industry

Insurance enables risk-taking by spreading it—until it concentrates risk systemically. From Italian merchants pooling maritime risks to AIG's credit default swaps, insurance has been essential infrastructure for economic activity. By allowing individuals and firms to transfer risks they can't bear to those who can, insurance enables investment, trade, and innovation that fear of loss would otherwise prevent. But insurance also creates moral hazard (reduced care when protected) and systemic risk (when insurers themselves fail). The industry's evolution—from Lloyd's coffee house to global reinsurance networks—shows both the power of risk markets and their persistent fragility.

## The Deeper Point

Insurance is [[Institutions and Progress|institutional]] infrastructure for risk-bearing—it enables [[Entrepreneurship|entrepreneurial]] activity that would otherwise be too risky. A merchant who couldn't insure cargo wouldn't send ships; a business that couldn't insure property wouldn't build factories. By pooling and pricing risks, insurance channels economic activity toward ventures where expected gains exceed properly measured risks. But insurance also creates institutional problems: moral hazard (the insured takes more risks), adverse selection (high-risk customers buy insurance), and systemic concentration (AIG insured risks it couldn't bear). The industry's recurring crises—Lloyd's in the 1990s, AIG in 2008—show that insurers can become risk concentrators rather than risk spreaders. The deeper function is price discovery: insurance premiums signal what risks actually cost, enabling efficient allocation. When climate change makes coastal insurance unaffordable, that's a signal—the market saying the risk isn't worth bearing. [[Business Regulation]] shapes whether insurance performs its enabling function or becomes a mechanism for speculation (CDS) or extraction. Insurance is the industry where the Baumol problem is starkest: the same actuarial talent can spread risk productively or concentrate it destructively.
