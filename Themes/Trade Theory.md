# Trade Theory

Why do countries trade? What determines who exports what? Should trade be free or managed? These questions have driven economic theory and policy for 250 years. From Adam Smith's critique of mercantilism to Ricardo's comparative advantage to modern theories of economies of scale and global value chains, trade theory explains one of history's most powerful forces for economic change—and remains politically contested because the gains from trade are real but unequally distributed.

## Overview

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Core question | Why trade, and who benefits? |
| Key concept | Comparative advantage |
| Policy debate | Free trade vs. protection |
| Evolution | Classical → HO → New Trade Theory |
| Contemporary | Global value chains, services |

## Classical Trade Theory

### Mercantilism (Pre-Smith)

| Belief | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Wealth = gold/silver | Trade surplus accumulates bullion |
| Trade as zero-sum | One country's gain is another's loss |
| Policy | Export much, import little |
| Tools | Tariffs, colonies, navigation acts |

### Adam Smith's Critique (1776)

| Innovation | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| Absolute advantage | Produce what you make cheapest |
| Mutual benefit | Both parties gain from trade |
| Division of labor | Specialization increases productivity |
| Market size | Larger markets enable more specialization |

### Ricardo's Comparative Advantage (1817)

| Core Insight | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| Even if one country is better at everything | Trade still benefits both |
| Opportunity cost | What you give up to produce |
| Specialize in | What you're relatively best at |
| Example | England cloth, Portugal wine |

### The Logic

| Country | Cloth (hours) | Wine (hours) |
|---------|---------------|--------------|
| England | 100 | 120 |
| Portugal | 90 | 80 |

Portugal is better at both, but relatively better at wine. England is relatively better at cloth. Both gain if England makes cloth, Portugal makes wine, and they trade.

|---------|-------------|
| Countries differ | In endowments of land, labor, capital |
| Trade pattern | Export goods intensive in abundant factor |

### Predictions

| Country Type | Exports |
|--------------|---------|
| Developed | Capital-intensive manufactures |
| Developing | Labor-intensive goods |
| Land-rich | Agricultural products |

| Theorem | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Trade tends to | Equalize factor prices across countries |
| Mechanism | Demand for scarce factors rises, abundant falls |
| Implication | Wages converge (somewhat) |
| Reality | Partial, impeded by barriers |

### Stolper-Samuelson

| Insight | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Trade helps | Abundant factor owners |
| Trade hurts | Scarce factor owners |
| In rich countries | Skilled workers gain, unskilled lose |
| In poor countries | Unskilled gain, capital owners lose |
| Political implication | Winners and losers create trade politics |

| Observation | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| Countries | Trade similar goods both ways |
| Example | Germany exports and imports cars |
| HO can't explain | Shouldn't specialize in same thing |

## Global Value Chains

### Trade in Tasks

| Shift | Description |
|-------|-------------|

| Phase | Characteristic |
|-------|----------------|
| First unbundling | Production separated from consumption (pre-1990) |
| Second unbundling | Production stages separated (1990s-2010s) |

## The Deeper Point

Trade theory demonstrates one of economics' most robust findings: mutual gains from exchange are real, even when partners are unequal. The logic of comparative advantage is counterintuitive but mathematically airtight. Yet the same theory that shows aggregate gains also shows distributional consequences—trade creates winners and losers, and the losers are often more politically visible. The failure to address distribution is why free trade became politically unsustainable in many democracies. Modern trade theory (increasing returns, path dependence, value chains) complicates but doesn't overturn the basic insight. The [[Deglobalization]] impulse reflects rediscovery of what trade theory always acknowledged: efficiency isn't everything, and countries may rationally sacrifice some gains for security, resilience, or distributional goals. The historical pattern—[[Trade Networks]] expand until disrupted, then rebuild—suggests trade will continue but may be organized differently. The theory remains valid; the policy choices depend on values.
