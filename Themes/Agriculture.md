# Agriculture

Agriculture is civilization's foundation—the production of food through deliberate cultivation of plants and raising of animals. Beginning around 10,000 BCE, agriculture enabled population growth, permanent settlements, and complex societies. Until industrialization, most humans worked the land, and agricultural surplus determined what else society could do. Understanding agriculture means understanding economic history's most fundamental activity.
