# Violence and Social Orders

*Violence and Social Orders: A Conceptual Framework for Interpreting Recorded Human History* (2009) by Douglass North, John Wallis, and Barry Weingast offers perhaps the most ambitious framework in institutional economics. Their question: how do societies control violence? Their answer: most of human history consists of **limited access orders** where elites share rents to maintain peace. Only recently have some societies become **open access orders** where competition is free and violence is controlled through impersonal institutions. This transition is rare, fragile, and revolutionary.

## Overview

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Authors | Douglass North, John Wallis, Barry Weingast |
| Published | 2009 |
| Core thesis | Two types of social orders; transition between them explains development |
| Key distinction | Limited access vs. open access orders |
| Scope | All of recorded human history |

## The Central Framework

### The Problem of Violence

| Challenge | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Violence capacity | Humans can harm each other |
| Disorder | Without control, violence makes cooperation impossible |
| State solution | States claim monopoly on legitimate violence |
| But how? | How do states actually control violence? |

### Two Social Orders

| Feature | Limited Access | Open Access |
|---------|----------------|-------------|
| Entry | Restricted to elites | Open to all |
| Organizations | Require elite permission | Anyone can form |
| Violence control | Rent-sharing among violent specialists | State monopoly, impersonal |
| Proportion of history | 99%+ | Recent, rare |
| Examples | Ancient empires, medieval kingdoms, most developing countries | Modern democracies |

---

## Limited Access Orders (Natural States)

### The Logic

| Step | Mechanism |
|------|-----------|
| 1 | Some individuals/groups can deploy violence |
| 2 | They could fight, destroying wealth |
| 3 | Instead, they agree to share rents |
| 4 | Each gets a portion; fighting would risk it |
| 5 | Stability through rent distribution |

### Characteristics

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Personal relationships | Deals between specific elites |
| Rent creation | Limit entry to create valuable privileges |
| Organizational control | Only elites can form organizations |
| Property rights | Personal, not institutional |
| Violence | Latent threat maintains equilibrium |

### Types of Limited Access Orders

| Type | Description | Examples |
|------|-------------|----------|
| Fragile | Minimal state, frequent violence | Failed states |
| Basic | State exists, few organizations | Early kingdoms |
| Mature | Multiple organizations, some durability | 18th-century Britain, modern developing countries |

### Historical Examples

| Society | How It Worked |
|---------|---------------|
| Medieval Europe | Lords shared rents through feudal hierarchy |
| Aztec Empire | Warrior nobles divided tribute |
| Ming China | Bureaucratic elite distributed posts |
| Colonial Africa | European and local elites shared extraction |

---

## Open Access Orders

### The Logic

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Impersonal rules | Laws apply to everyone equally |
| Free entry | Anyone can form organizations, start businesses |
| Political competition | Multiple parties compete for power |
| Economic competition | Markets open to all |
| Violence | State monopoly, legitimate only through law |

### Characteristics

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Impersonal exchange | Don't need to know trading partner |
| Rule of law | Same rules for everyone |
| Perpetually lived organizations | Firms, parties outlast founders |
| Property rights | Institutional, not personal |
| Creative destruction | Competition destroys incumbents |

### Modern Examples

| Country | Status |
|---------|--------|
| United States | Open access |
| Western Europe | Open access |
| Japan | Open access |
| Some others | Borderline or transitioning |
| Most of world | Still limited access |

## The Transition

### Why It's Rare

| Challenge | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Elites lose rents | Open competition threatens them |
| Elites control violence | Can block transition |
| Self-interest | Rational to maintain limited access |
| Result | Most societies never transition |

### The Doorstep Conditions

For transition to be possible, limited access orders must first develop:

| Condition | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Rule of law for elites | Elites treat each other according to rules |
| Perpetually lived organizations | Organizations outlast individual members |
| Political control of military | Consolidated civilian command |

### The Transition Logic

| Step | Mechanism |
|------|-----------|
| 1 | Elites develop impersonal relations among themselves |
| 2 | Elite privileges become rights (open to all elites) |
| 3 | Then rights extend to non-elites |
| 4 | Entry opens, competition begins |
| 5 | Limited access → open access |

### Historical Cases

| Case | Transition |
|------|------------|
| Britain (1688-1832) | Glorious Revolution → Reform Acts |
| France (1789-1870) | Revolution → multiple attempts → Third Republic |
| United States (1776-1870s) | Revolution → Civil War → Reconstruction |
| Japan (1868-1950s) | Meiji → defeat → occupation reforms |

## Implications

### For Development

| Lesson | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Institutions can't be imposed | Must grow from elite agreements |
| Democracy isn't enough | Need doorstep conditions first |
| Washington Consensus failed | Assumed open access logic would work in limited access |
| Time required | Transitions take generations |

### For Policy

| Implication | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| Sequencing matters | Build elite rule of law first |
| Don't expect quick results | Institutional change is slow |
| Context matters | What works depends on social order type |
| Violence is key | Must address how violence is controlled |

### For Understanding History

| Insight | Application |
|---------|-------------|
| Most history is limited access | Don't project open access assumptions backward |
| Rent-seeking isn't pathology | It's how limited access maintains peace |
| Corruption is systemic | Not individual moral failure |
| Reform is hard | Threatens the stability mechanism |

---

## Critiques and Debates

### Strengths

| Claim | Support |
|-------|---------|
| Violence-centered | Focuses on what states actually do |
| Historical scope | Applies to all recorded history |
| Explains persistence | Why bad institutions last |
| Policy realistic | Doesn't assume easy reform |

### Weaknesses

| Critique | Argument |
|----------|----------|
| Binary too simple | Spectrum might be more accurate |
| Transition unclear | Doorstep conditions are vague |
| Western bias | Open access modeled on West |
| China problem | Doesn't fit framework neatly |
| Tautology risk | "Open access societies are developed because developed societies have open access" |

### The China Challenge

| Question | Difficulty |
|----------|------------|
| China grew fast | Under limited access |
| No political liberalization | Still authoritarian |
| NWW prediction | Limited access can't sustain growth |
| Counter | Maybe they're wrong, or China will stall |

## Connection to Other Frameworks

### vs. Acemoglu & Robinson

| NWW | A&R |
|-----|-----|
| Limited vs. open access | Extractive vs. inclusive |
| Violence-centered | Rent-centered |
| Doorstep conditions | Critical junctures |
| Complementary | Different emphases |

### vs. Olson

| NWW | Olson |
|-----|-------|
| Social orders | Distributional coalitions |
| Violence as key | Collective action as key |
| Limited access = rent-sharing | Sclerosis = rent-seeking accumulation |
| Builds on | Stationary bandit idea |

### vs. North's Earlier Work

| Earlier North | NWW |
|---------------|-----|
| Transaction costs | Violence control |
| Institutions as rules | Social orders as systems |
| Evolution | Revolutionary transition |
| Synthesis | Incorporates earlier insights |

## Key Quotes

> "The natural state reduces the problem of endemic violence through the creation of rents."

> "Limited access orders are stable not because they are good or because citizens prefer them, but because they control violence."

> "The transition from limited to open access is not a simple matter of improving institutions. It requires a fundamental transformation in how elites relate to each other and to the rest of society."
