# Transportation Cost Curves

How moving goods got cheaper is a story of successive revolutions: from pack animals to wheeled transport to canals to rail to steam ships to containers to air freight. Each reduction in transport costs reshaped trade patterns, expanded markets, and enabled new forms of economic organization. When it costs less to move goods, more trade happens, specialization deepens, and economies integrate. Transport costs are the friction in the economic machine; reducing them accelerates everything else.

## Overview

| Era | Dominant mode | Cost trend |
|-----|---------------|------------|
| Ancient | Pack, cart, sail | High, stable |
| Medieval | Same, some improvement | Slow decline |
| 18th-19th c. | Canals, then rail | Sharp decline |
| 19th-20th c. | Steam ships | Sharp decline |
| 20th c. | Containers, air | Another sharp decline |

## Pre-Industrial Transport

### Land Transport

| Mode | Cost (relative) |
|------|-----------------|
| Human porter | Highest |
| Pack animal | High |
| Cart/wagon | Lower on roads |
| Winter sledge | Sometimes cheaper |

### Cost Implications

| Reality | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| Overland expensive | Local trade dominant |
| Bulk goods | Couldn't move far |
| High value | Worth transport cost |
| Cities | Near water |

### Water Transport

| Advantage | Character |
|-----------|-----------|
| Cost | 1/10th to 1/20th of land |
| Bulk | Could move heavy goods |
| Range | Mediterranean, rivers |
| Limitation | Only where water goes |

## Canal Age

### British Canals

| Period | Development |
|--------|-------------|
| 1760s-1830s | Canal mania |
| Effect | Connected coalfields, cities |
| Cost reduction | Dramatic for bulk |
| Limitation | Slow, freezing |

### European Canals

| Region | Development |
|--------|-------------|
| Netherlands | Extensive network |
| France | Some major canals |
| Germany | Later development |

## Railroad Revolution

### Cost Reduction

| Comparison | Factor |
|------------|--------|
| Road to rail | 10x cheaper |
| Speed | Much faster |
| All-weather | Reliable |
| Overland | Any terrain |

### Economic Effects

| Effect | Mechanism |
|--------|-----------|
| Market expansion | Larger trading areas |
| Specialization | Regional comparative advantage |
| Perishables | Fresh goods could move |
| Industrial | Factory location flexible |

### [[Railroad Revolution|Railroad's]] Impact

| Pattern | Change |
|---------|--------|
| Before | Local markets, local prices |
| After | National markets, converging prices |
| Winner | Efficient producers |
| Loser | Protected local producers |

## Steam Shipping

### The Breakthrough

| Development | Effect |
|-------------|--------|
| Steamships | Reliable, scheduled |
| Iron/steel hulls | Larger, cheaper |
| Suez Canal (1869) | Asia-Europe shortcut |
| Refrigeration | Perishables globally |

### Ocean Freight Rates

| Period | Trend |
|--------|-------|
| 1840-1914 | Fell 70%+ |
| Effect | Global trade boom |
| Integration | Global commodity markets |

### First Globalization

| Factor | Role |
|--------|------|
| Steam ships | Enabled bulk trade |
| Railroads | Interior access |
| Telegraph | Information |
| Result | 1870-1914 integration |

## Containerization

### The Innovation

| Feature | Character |
|---------|-----------|
| Standard box | Intermodal transfer |
| Inventor | Malcolm McLean, 1956 |
| Effect | Transformed shipping |
| Cost reduction | 90%+ for many goods |

### Before Containers

| Problem | Cost |
|---------|------|
| Break-bulk | Loading/unloading expensive |
| Pilferage | Goods stolen |
| Time | Ships in port weeks |
| Labor | Many dockworkers |

### After Containers

| Change | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Standardization | Automated handling |
| Speed | Days in port → hours |
| Security | Sealed containers |
| Cost | Collapsed |

### [[Containerization|Economic Effects]]

| Effect | Mechanism |
|--------|-----------|
| [[Global Supply Chains]] | Feasible |
| Asian manufacturing | Connected to markets |
| Deindustrialization | Some places |
| Trade boom | Post-1970 |

## Air Freight

### Characteristics

| Feature | Character |
|---------|-----------|
| Speed | Fastest |
| Cost | Highest per ton |
| Goods | High-value, perishable, urgent |
| Share | ~1% of tonnage, ~35% of value |

### What Flies

| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| Electronics | Phones, chips |
| Fashion | Fast fashion |
| Flowers | Fresh-cut |
| Medical | Organs, vaccines |
| E-commerce | Express delivery |

## Economic Patterns

### Cost Reduction Effects

| When costs fall | Effect |
|-----------------|--------|
| Markets expand | Larger trading areas |
| Prices converge | Arbitrage |
| Specialization | Comparative advantage |
| Integration | Factor price equalization |

### Who Benefits

| Beneficiary | Mechanism |
|-------------|-----------|
| Consumers | Lower prices, variety |
| Efficient producers | Larger markets |
| Coastal areas | Better access |

### Who Loses

| Loser | Mechanism |
|-------|-----------|
| Inefficient producers | Competition |
| Landlocked areas | Still expensive |
| Port workers | After containers |

## The Deeper Point

Transport costs are the friction that determines trade patterns. When costs are high, only local exchange is viable; production must happen near consumption. Each transport revolution—canals, [[Railroad Revolution|railroads]], [[Shipping and Maritime Trade|steamships]], [[Containerization|containers]]—reduced friction, expanded markets, and deepened specialization. The effects compound: railroads made interior regions accessible; steamships integrated continents; containers made [[Global Supply Chains|global supply chains]] possible. But the gains are uneven: coastal cities benefit most; landlocked regions remain disadvantaged; workers in disrupted industries lose. The first [[Globalization|globalization]] (1870-1914) was a transport revolution: falling shipping costs enabled Argentina to feed Britain, Australia to clothe Europe, Asian commodities to reach world markets. The post-1970 globalization was another: containers made it cheaper to manufacture in China and ship to America than to manufacture in America. [[Institutions and Progress|Institutions]] matter here too—transportation infrastructure requires investment, property rights for routes, and political stability to maintain. The transport cost curve is a driver of history: when it falls, trade expands, and everything changes.
