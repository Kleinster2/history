# Migration and Economic Opportunity

People migrate toward opportunity. From villages to cities, from old world to new, from persecution to tolerance—migration patterns reveal where institutions channeled economic hope. Diaspora networks—Jewish, Armenian, Chinese, Indian—created trade connections across hostile borders. Forced migrations—slavery, indenture, refugee flows—show how institutions could coerce as well as attract. Migration is the vote with feet: it reveals, more honestly than any official measure, where people believed they could thrive.

## Overview

| Type | Character |
|------|-----------|
| Internal | Village to city |
| International | Across borders |
| Diaspora | Network-based trade |
| Forced | Slavery, indenture, displacement |
| Modern | Global labor flows |

## Internal Migration: Village to City

### The Pattern

| Era | Flow |
|-----|------|
| Medieval | Rural to urban |
| Early modern | Intensifying |
| Industrial | Massive urbanization |
| Modern | Developing world urbanizes |

### Why Cities

| Attraction | Mechanism |
|------------|-----------|
| Wages | Higher than rural |
| Freedom | Escape serfdom/bondage |
| Opportunity | More occupations |
| Services | Markets, courts, social life |
| Risk | Disease, poverty also higher |

### "City Air Makes Free"

| Principle | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| Medieval doctrine | Serf free after one year |
| Effect | Drew ambitious peasants |
| Limit | Not universal, varied by city |
| Legacy | Cities as freedom spaces |

### Indian Networks

| Feature | Character |
|---------|-----------|

### Why Diasporas Worked

| Advantage | Mechanism |
|-----------|-----------|
| Trust | Community enforcement |
| Information | Shared among co-ethnics |
| Intermediation | Connected hostile societies |
| Flexibility | Moved with opportunity |
| Disadvantage | Subject to expulsion, persecution |

## Colonial Migration

### Settler Colonies

| Destination | Origin |
|-------------|--------|
| Americas | Europe, then global |

| South Africa | Dutch, British |
| New Zealand | British |

### Motivations

| Push | Pull |
|------|------|
| Poverty | Land availability |
| Persecution | Religious freedom |
| Overpopulation | Economic opportunity |
| Enclosure | Free land |

### Consequences

| For settlers | For indigenous |
|--------------|----------------|
| Opportunity | Dispossession |
| Land ownership | Land loss |
| New society | Cultural destruction |
| Wealth | Poverty |

## Forced Migration

### [[Slavery Economics|Atlantic Slave Trade]]

| Scale | 12+ million transported |
|-------|------------------------|
| Origin | West Africa |
| Destination | Americas |
| Purpose | Plantation labor |
| Duration | 1500-1870 |

### Indentured Labor

| System | Character |
|--------|-----------|
| Post-slavery | Replaced slave labor |
| Origins | India, China, Pacific |
| Destinations | Caribbean, Indian Ocean, Pacific |
| Terms | Years of bound labor |
| Scale | Millions |

### Refugee Flows

| Cause | Example |
|-------|---------|

| Political upheaval | French Revolution, Russian |
| War | WWII, modern conflicts |
| Economic | Irish Famine |

## Industrial Migration

### European Emigration

| Period | Numbers |

| 1815-1914 | ~55 million emigrants |
| Origins | Britain, Ireland, Germany, Italy, Eastern Europe |
| Destinations | Americas, Australia, Argentina |
| Peak | 1880s-1914 |

### Why They Left

| Push | Pull |
|------|------|
| Poverty | Higher wages |
| Land scarcity | Abundant land |
| Persecution | Freedom |
| Population growth | Labor demand |

### Chain Migration

| Mechanism | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| Family connection | Information, assistance |
| Remittances | Funded subsequent migration |
| Ethnic enclaves | Eased transition |
| Networks | Perpetuated flows |

## Modern Global Migration

### Patterns

| Flow | Character |
|------|-----------|
| South to North | Developing to developed |
| South to South | Between developing countries |
| Highly skilled | Brain drain/gain |
| Low skilled | Labor migration |
| Irregular | Undocumented flows |

### Remittances

| Scale | Significance |
|-------|--------------|
| $700+ billion/year | Major flow |
| Many countries | Exceeds FDI, aid |
| Household impact | Poverty reduction |
| Macro impact | Foreign exchange |

### Restrictions

| Development | Effect |
|-------------|--------|
| Pre-WWI | Relatively open |
| Post-WWI | Restrictions rise |
| Post-WWII | Some opening |
| Present | Heavy regulation |

## The Deeper Point

Migration reveals [[Institutions and Progress|institutional]] quality more honestly than any official measure. People move toward opportunity—toward places where their labor is valued, their property secure, their freedom protected. The medieval village-to-city flow reflected urban institutions offering freedom from serfdom. European emigration to the Americas reflected the promise of land and liberty. Diaspora networks formed because certain groups could trust each other across borders that mainstream populations couldn't bridge. The [[Overseas Chinese Networks|Chinese]] diaspora built businesses across Southeast Asia; [[Jewish Diaspora Economy|Jewish]] networks connected Christian and Muslim worlds; Armenian merchants linked Europe to Persia to India. These networks succeeded because they could enforce contracts through community mechanisms where legal systems failed. Forced migration—slavery, indenture, displacement—shows institutions could also coerce movement. The overall pattern: people flow toward better institutions when they can, and create institutional substitutes (diaspora networks) when formal institutions fail them. Migration is the market for institutions.
