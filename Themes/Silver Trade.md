# Silver Trade

Silver from Spanish American mines—particularly Potosí and Mexican deposits—transformed the early modern world economy. Silver flows created the first truly global trading system, connecting the Americas, Europe, and Asia. The metal served as money in China, funded European wars, and caused price revolutions across continents. Understanding silver trade illuminates early globalization and monetary history.
