# Agricultural Productivity Revolution

Agricultural productivity freed labor for everything else. Medieval innovations—heavy plow, horse collar, three-field rotation—doubled European output. The British Agricultural Revolution—enclosure, selective breeding, new rotations—freed workers for industry. The [[Green Revolution]]—high-yield varieties, fertilizers, irrigation—fed billions. Each breakthrough broke a constraint, enabling specialization, urbanization, and economic transformation. Agriculture is the essential precondition: without food surplus, no civilization.

## Overview

| Revolution | Period | Effect |
|------------|--------|--------|
| [[Medieval Agricultural Technology\|Medieval]] | 800-1300 | Doubled European productivity |
| British | 1700-1850 | Freed labor for industry |
| [[Green Revolution]] | 1960s-1980s | Fed developing world |
| Modern | Ongoing | Precision, biotechnology |

## Medieval Improvements

### Key Innovations

| Innovation | Effect |
|------------|--------|
| Heavy plow | Northern clay soils cultivable |
| Horse collar | Faster plowing |
| Three-field rotation | 50% more land under cultivation |
| Water/wind mills | Mechanized grinding |

### Productivity Gains

| Measure | Improvement |
|---------|-------------|
| Yields | 3:1 → 4:1 seed-to-harvest |
| Land | More under cultivation |
| Labor | More efficient |
| Surplus | Enabled urbanization |

### Preconditions for Commercial Revolution

| Agricultural | Commercial |
|--------------|------------|
| Food surplus | Fed cities |
| Labor surplus | Supplied workers |
| Income | Created demand |
| Trade | Surplus to sell |

## British Agricultural Revolution

### Enclosure

| Feature | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| Open fields | Consolidated |
| Commons | Privatized |
| Property rights | Clarified |
| Efficiency | Increased (disputed) |
| Displacement | Rural workers pushed out |

### Innovation

| Development | Effect |
|-------------|--------|
| Selective breeding | Better livestock |
| New rotations | Norfolk four-course |
| Root crops | Turnips fed animals |
| Legumes | Nitrogen fixation |
| Drainage | More land usable |

### Productivity Gains

| Measure | Improvement |
|---------|-------------|
| Output per worker | Doubled, 1700-1850 |
| Agricultural workforce | 80% → 22% (England) |
| Freed labor | For industry |
| Food security | Generally adequate |

### Connection to Industrialization

| Agricultural change | Industrial effect |
|---------------------|-------------------|
| Labor released | Factory workers |
| Food surplus | Fed industrial population |
| Rural demand | Market for manufactures |
| Capital | Some agricultural profits invested |

## Mechanization

### Early Machines

| Innovation | Effect |
|------------|--------|
| Seed drill (Tull) | Efficient planting |
| Threshing machine | Labor saving |
| Reaping machine (McCormick) | Harvest mechanized |

### Tractors

| Development | Effect |
|-------------|--------|
| Steam power | Limited application |
| Internal combustion | Practical tractor |
| 20th century | Transformative |
| Labor | Radically reduced |

### Combine Harvester

| Development | Effect |
|-------------|--------|
| Cut, thresh, clean | One machine |
| Labor | Enormous reduction |
| Scale | Larger farms viable |

## Green Revolution

### Components

| Innovation | Effect |
|------------|--------|
| High-yield varieties | 2-3x production |
| Fertilizers | Soil supplementation |
| Irrigation | Water control |
| Pesticides | Crop protection |

### Results

| Measure | Achievement |
|---------|-------------|
| Asia | Food self-sufficiency |
| India, Pakistan | Famine ended |
| Global food prices | Fell |
| Population | Fed billions more |

### Criticisms

| Issue | Concern |
|-------|---------|
| Environmental | Chemicals, water use |
| Social | Favored large farms |
| Dependence | On inputs |
| Sustainability | Long-term questions |

## Modern Agriculture

### Precision Farming

| Technology | Application |
|------------|-------------|
| GPS | Precise positioning |
| Sensors | Soil, crop monitoring |
| Variable rate | Targeted inputs |
| Data | Decision support |

### Biotechnology

| Development | Effect |
|-------------|--------|
| GMOs | Pest resistance, yield |
| Genetic improvement | Accelerated |
| Controversy | Social, regulatory |

### Productivity Levels

| Comparison | Effect |
|------------|--------|
| 1800 | One farmer fed 4-5 |
| 1900 | One farmer fed 10 |
| 2000 | One farmer fed 100+ |
| Modern US | 2% of labor in agriculture |

## Labor and Land Productivity

### Two Types

| Type | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Labor productivity | Output per worker |
| Land productivity | Output per hectare |

### Historical Patterns

| Region | Emphasis |
|--------|----------|
| Land-scarce Asia | Intensive, high land productivity |
| Labor-scarce Americas | Extensive, high labor productivity |
| Europe | Shifted over time |

## The Deeper Point

Agricultural productivity is the essential precondition for economic development. Without [[Food and Subsistence|food surplus]], no one can do anything except produce food. Every agricultural breakthrough—[[Medieval Agricultural Technology|medieval]], British, [[Green Revolution|Green]]—broke a constraint: the plow opened new lands; enclosure concentrated property; mechanization replaced labor; high-yield varieties multiplied output. Each breakthrough freed labor and resources for other activities: cities, industry, services. The pattern is consistent: agricultural transformation precedes industrial transformation. Britain's [[Industrial Revolution]] required agricultural workers becoming factory workers—which required fewer farmers feeding more people. Asia's post-1960s development required the Green Revolution's food security. But agricultural transformation is not automatic: it requires [[Institutions and Progress|institutions]] that incentivize investment and innovation. Enclosure was controversial precisely because it changed property rights; the Green Revolution succeeded where institutional support (extension services, credit, markets) existed. Agricultural productivity reveals the material foundation of progress: you cannot specialize, urbanize, or industrialize until you can feed people without everyone farming. That's why agricultural technology matters for everything else.
