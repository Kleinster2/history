# US Dollar

The US dollar became the world's dominant currency at Bretton Woods (1944) and remains so today—the most successful reserve currency in history. Unlike its predecessors, the dollar survived losing its gold backing (1971) and emerged stronger. Its dominance rests not on gold or empire but on network effects, financial market depth, and the absence of credible alternatives.

## Overview

| Feature | Details |
|---------|---------|
| Name | United States dollar |
| Symbol | $ |
| Subdivisions | 100 cents |
| First minted | 1792 (Coinage Act) |
| Model | [[Spanish Dollar]] (same weight) |
| Dominance begins | 1944 (Bretton Woods) |
| Current status | World's primary reserve currency |

## Origins

### The Coinage Act of 1792

| Feature | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| Signed by | George Washington |
| Dollar definition | 371.25 grains pure silver |
| Gold eagle | $10 gold coin |
| Model | Spanish dollar (piece of eight) |
| Bimetallic | Both gold and silver |

### Why the Spanish Dollar?

| Reason | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Already circulating | Piece of eight was de facto currency |
| Familiar | Americans knew it |
| Trusted | Centuries of stability |
| Practical | Matched existing trade |

The US dollar was literally designed to replace the Spanish dollar in American commerce.

## Pre-Dominance Era (1792-1944)

### The Young Dollar

| Period | Status |
|--------|--------|
| 1792-1861 | Bimetallic, multiple currencies |
| 1861-1879 | Civil War, greenbacks, chaos |
| 1879-1914 | Gold standard |
| 1914-1944 | Rising but not dominant |

### The Federal Reserve (1913)

| Feature | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| Created | 1913 |
| Purpose | Lender of last resort |
| Trigger | Panic of 1907 |
| Structure | 12 regional banks |
| Evolution | Became modern central bank |

### World War I: The Turning Point

| Before WWI | After WWI |
|------------|-----------|
| US: debtor nation | US: creditor nation |
| Sterling dominant | Dollar rivals sterling |
| London: center | New York rises |
| Gold flows to London | Gold flows to New York |

## Bretton Woods (1944)

### The Conference

| Feature | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| Location | Bretton Woods, New Hampshire |
| Date | July 1944 |
| Delegates | 44 nations |
| US position | Dominant (only solvent ally) |
| Key figures | Harry Dexter White (US), John Maynard Keynes (UK) |

### The System

| Element | Design |
|---------|--------|
| Dollar-gold link | $35 = 1 oz gold |
| Other currencies | Pegged to dollar |
| Convertibility | Dollars → gold (for governments) |
| Adjustment | Fixed but adjustable rates |
| Institutions | IMF, World Bank |

### Why the Dollar Won

| Factor | US Advantage (1944) |
|--------|---------------------|
| GDP | 50% of world output |
| Gold reserves | 2/3 of world's gold |
| Industrial capacity | Intact, expanded |
| Military | Unmatched |
| Creditor | Everyone owed US |
| Geography | No war damage |

Keynes proposed an international currency ("bancor"). White's dollar-centered plan won because America had the leverage.

## The Bretton Woods Era (1944-1971)

### How It Worked

| Flow | Mechanism |
|------|-----------|
| US printed dollars | World needed dollars |
| Dollars went abroad | Via aid, investment, trade deficits |
| Foreigners held dollars | As reserves, for trade |
| Dollar = gold | At $35/oz |

### The Triffin Dilemma

| Problem | Explanation |
|---------|-------------|
| World needed dollars | Liquidity for growing trade |
| US had to run deficits | Only way to supply dollars |
| Deficits eroded confidence | Too many dollars vs. gold |
| Contradiction | System undermined itself |

### The Gold Drain

| Year | US Gold Reserves |
|------|-----------------|
| 1949 | $24.6 billion |
| 1960 | $17.8 billion |
| 1968 | $10.9 billion |
| 1971 | $10.2 billion |

Foreign dollar holdings exceeded US gold reserves by late 1960s.

## Nixon Shock (1971)

### The Decision

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| August 15, 1971 | Nixon closes gold window |
| Announcement | Sunday night TV address |
| Effect | Dollar no longer convertible |
| Other measures | Wage-price controls, import surcharge |

### Why Nixon Acted

| Pressure | Source |
|----------|--------|
| France | Demanded gold for dollars |
| Vietnam War | Inflationary spending |
| Trade deficit | Growing |
| Speculation | Against dollar |

### What Everyone Expected

| Prediction | Reality |
|------------|---------|
| Dollar collapse | Dollar remained dominant |
| Monetary chaos | System adjusted |
| Gold surge | Yes, but dollar survived |
| Alternatives rise | None ready |

## The Floating Dollar (1971-Present)

### The Non-System

| Feature | Post-Bretton Woods |
|---------|-------------------|
| Exchange rates | Floating (mostly) |
| Dollar role | Still central |
| Gold | Demonetized |
| Reserves | Still mostly dollars |

### Why Dollar Dominance Continued

| Factor | Mechanism |
|--------|-----------|
| No alternative | Euro not ready; yen limited |
| Network effects | Everyone already used dollars |
| Financial markets | Deepest, most liquid |
| Petrodollar | Oil priced in dollars |
| US military | Security umbrella |
| Inertia | Costly to switch |

### The Petrodollar

| Deal | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Date | 1974 |
| Parties | US and Saudi Arabia |
| Terms | Oil priced/sold in dollars |
| Effect | Global dollar demand |
| Mechanism | Oil importers need dollars |

## Current Dominance

### The Numbers

| Metric | Dollar Share |
|--------|--------------|
| Global reserves | ~60% |
| Forex turnover | ~88% of transactions |
| Trade invoicing | ~40-50% |
| SWIFT payments | ~40% |
| Commodity pricing | Most major commodities |
| Debt issuance | Majority of international bonds |

### Why It Persists

| Factor | Strength |
|--------|----------|
| Market depth | Trillions in daily trading |
| Safe haven | Flight to dollars in crisis |
| US economy | Still largest or second largest |
| Military | Unmatched global reach |
| Rule of law | Property rights, contracts |
| Fed credibility | Inflation controlled (mostly) |

## Challenges

### Potential Threats

| Challenge | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| **China/RMB** | Large economy but closed financial system |
| **Euro** | Significant but fragmented fiscal policy |
| **Sanctions overuse** | May accelerate diversification |
| **US debt** | Long-term credibility question |
| **Crypto** | Too volatile, too small |
| **CBDCs** | Uncertain impact |

### De-Dollarization Efforts

| Country/Bloc | Effort |
|--------------|--------|
| China | RMB internationalization |
| Russia | Post-sanctions shift |
| BRICS | Alternative payment systems |
| EU | Euro promotion |
| Result so far | Marginal impact |

### Why Alternatives Struggle

| Currency | Problem |
|----------|---------|
| Euro | No fiscal union, fragmented markets |
| RMB | Capital controls, rule of law concerns |
| Yen | Japanese economy shrinking |
| Crypto | Volatility, regulation |

## The Dollar's Future

### Historical Pattern

| Transition | Lag |
|------------|-----|
| Florin → Ducat | ~100 years |
| Ducat → Spanish Dollar | ~100 years |
| Spanish Dollar → Guilder | ~50 years |
| Guilder → Pound | ~50 years |
| Pound → Dollar | ~70-80 years |

If the pattern holds, dollar dominance could persist for decades after US economic hegemony fades.

### What Would Trigger Transition?

| Scenario | Likelihood |
|----------|------------|
| US fiscal crisis | Possible long-term |
| Better alternative emerges | Not yet visible |
| Geopolitical fragmentation | Gradual |
| US policy mistakes | Sanctions overreach? |
| War or major crisis | Unknown |

## The Deeper Point

The dollar's survival after 1971 is the most important monetary fact of our era. Every previous dominant currency depended on metal backing (gold or silver) or institutional backing (banking systems, trade networks). The dollar proved that a fiat currency—backed by nothing but confidence—could remain dominant through network effects alone.

This creates a strange stability. The dollar dominates not because America is rising (relative power has declined since 1945) but because alternatives aren't ready and switching costs are high. The Bretton Woods system required American economic hegemony; the post-1971 system requires only that America be "good enough" and that alternatives be worse.

The risk is complacency. The Dutch thought the Bank of Amsterdam was eternal; the British thought sterling was permanent. American policymakers increasingly use the dollar as a weapon (sanctions, SWIFT exclusion), which may accelerate the search for alternatives. The dollar's dominance is robust but not guaranteed.

History suggests the question isn't whether the dollar will be replaced, but when and by what. That "what" doesn't yet exist—which may be the dollar's greatest strength.
