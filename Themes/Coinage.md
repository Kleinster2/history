# Coinage

Coinage—standardized metal money guaranteed by state authority—transformed economic life. Invented in Lydia around 600 BCE, coins spread rapidly through the ancient world, enabling market transactions, state finance, and long-distance trade. From Greek drachmas to Roman denarii to Islamic dinars, coinage reflected and shaped economic development. Understanding money's history means understanding how states, markets, and trust interacted.
