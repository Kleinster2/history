# Opium Trade

The opium trade—particularly the British-dominated flow from India to China—was one of history's most consequential and destructive commercial enterprises. It reversed centuries of silver flowing to China, caused widespread addiction, and precipitated wars that opened China to Western imperialism. The opium trade demonstrates how commerce can be weaponized and how drug economies shape global politics.
