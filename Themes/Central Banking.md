# Central Banking

Central banks are the institutional response to financial system fragility. From the Bank of England's creation (1694) to the Federal Reserve's quantitative easing, central banks evolved from government financiers to crisis managers to economic stabilizers. They manage money supply, serve as lender of last resort, and supervise banks—three functions that didn't naturally cluster until experience taught that financial panics required a single institution with both the resources and the authority to stop them. The history of central banking is the history of learning, painfully, what monetary systems need to function.

## Overview

## The Gold Standard Era

### How It Worked

| Mechanism | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Currency-gold link | Fixed exchange rate to gold |
| Convertibility | Notes exchangeable for gold |
| Adjustment | Trade deficits → gold outflow → deflation |
| Central bank role | Maintain gold reserves, manage adjustment |

### The Classical System (1870-1914)

| Feature | Character |
|---------|-----------|
| Stability | Low inflation, fixed rates |
| Credibility | "Good as gold" |
| Deflation bias | Prices often fell |
| Unemployment | Adjustment fell on workers |
| Bank of England | "Conductor of the orchestra" |

### Limitations

| Problem | Consequence |
|---------|-------------|
| Deflationary | Sustained price declines |
| Rigid | No response to shocks |
| Unemployment | Workers bore adjustment |
| Distributional | Favored creditors over debtors |
| Colonial extraction | Gold from South Africa, India |

## Interwar Collapse

### The System Broke

| Event | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| WWI | Gold standard suspended |
| 1920s | Attempted restoration |

| 1930s | Competitive devaluations, bank failures |
| Policy failure | Central banks tightened into depression |

### The Fed's Founding and Failure

| Phase | Character |
|-------|-----------|

### Collapse (1971)

| Problem | Why |
|---------|-----|
| Triffin dilemma | World needed dollars; US printed them |
| Gold drain | Foreign claims exceeded US gold |

## The Deeper Point

Central banks are [[Institutions and Progress|institutional]] responses to a fundamental tension: money is too important to leave to markets, but too dangerous to leave to politics. The Bank of England emerged from war finance but became lender of last resort through experience—1866's Overend Gurney panic taught Bagehot's lesson. The Fed was created after 1907's panic but failed catastrophically in 1929-33, teaching that having a central bank isn't enough if it doesn't act. The modern consensus—independent, inflation-targeting, lender of last resort—represents hard-won knowledge. But 2008 showed the consensus incomplete: price stability didn't prevent financial instability, and QE's distributional effects reopened questions about democratic legitimacy. Central banks channel [[Entrepreneurship|entrepreneurial]] ambition through the cost and availability of credit—tight money constrains, easy money enables. The [[Financial Crises|crisis]] cycle suggests they haven't solved the fundamental problem: they can stop panics (2008 proved that) but may enable the leverage that causes them. Central banking is institutional engineering against systemic fragility—successful enough to persist, flawed enough to keep evolving.
