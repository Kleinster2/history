# Food and Subsistence

Food security is the foundation. Without caloric surplus, no specialization; without specialization, no cities, no trade, no progress. For most of history, societies lived at the Malthusian edge—population pressing against food supply, famine a regular threat. The [[Agricultural Productivity Revolution|agricultural revolution]] broke these constraints, but global food security remains precarious. Diet reveals development: what people eat, how much they eat, and whether they eat at all tells the story of economic progress more honestly than GDP.

## Overview

| Era | Food situation |
|-----|----------------|
| Hunter-gatherer | Varied, often adequate |
| Agricultural | Grain-based, periodic famine |
| Pre-industrial | Subsistence for most |
| Industrial | Improving, then abundant |
| Modern | Surplus in rich countries, deficits elsewhere |

## The Malthusian Trap

### The Logic

| Element | Mechanism |
|---------|-----------|
| Population grows | When food adequate |
| Food limited | Agricultural technology fixed |
| Wages fall | More workers, same land |
| Famine/disease | Population falls |
| Recovery | Cycle repeats |

### Pre-Industrial Reality

| Fact | Evidence |
|------|----------|
| No sustained growth | Living standards cyclical |
| Population oscillation | Growth then crisis |
| Wages track population | Inverse relationship |
| Technology slow | Couldn't escape trap |

### Breaking the Trap

| Requirement | Mechanism |
|-------------|-----------|
| Agricultural productivity | Faster than population |
| Technology | Cumulative improvement |
| Institutions | Incentives for innovation |
| Timing | Britain 18th-19th c. first |

## What People Ate

### Ancient/Medieval Diet

| Class | Diet |
|-------|------|
| Peasants | Grain (bread, porridge), vegetables, little meat |
| Urban workers | Bread, some variety |
| Elite | Meat, variety, abundance |
| Calories | 2,000-3,000 when adequate |

### Regional Variation

| Region | Staple |
|--------|--------|
| Europe | Wheat, rye, oats |
| East Asia | Rice |
| Americas (post-Columbian) | Maize, potatoes |
| Africa | Millet, sorghum |
| South Asia | Rice, wheat |

### Diet Changes

| Period | Shift |
|--------|-------|
| Post-[[Black Death]] | More meat (fewer people) |
| Columbian Exchange | New crops (potato, maize) |
| Industrial | More varied, processed |
| Modern | Global, abundant (rich countries) |

## Famines

### Causes

| Cause | Example |
|-------|---------|
| Weather | Crop failure |
| War | Destruction, requisition |
| Disease | Potato blight |
| Policy | Bengal 1943, China 1959-61 |
| Market failure | Distribution breakdown |

### Major Famines

| Event | Deaths | Cause |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Great Famine 1315-22 | 10-15% of Europe | Climate, disease |
| Irish Famine 1845-52 | 1 million | Blight + policy |
| Bengal 1943 | 2-3 million | War + policy |
| China 1959-61 | 15-45 million | Policy (Great Leap) |
| Ethiopian 1983-85 | 1 million | Drought + war |

### Famine and Institutions

| Pattern | Explanation |
|---------|-------------|
| Sen's thesis | Famine = entitlement failure |
| Not just production | Distribution matters |
| Democracies | Rare famines |
| War | Major cause |
| Market access | Prevents local shortage |

## Agricultural Revolutions

### Medieval

| Innovation | Effect |
|------------|--------|
| Heavy plow | Northern Europe cultivable |
| Three-field rotation | 50% more land |
| Horse collar | Faster plowing |
| Mills | Grinding capacity |

### British Agricultural Revolution

| Innovation | Effect |
|------------|--------|
| Enclosure | Larger, more efficient farms |
| Selective breeding | Better livestock |
| Crop rotation | Higher yields |
| New crops | Turnips, clover |
| Labor productivity | Freed workers for industry |

### [[Green Revolution]]

| Innovation | Effect |
|------------|--------|
| High-yield varieties | 2-3x yields |
| Fertilizers | Soil supplementation |
| Irrigation | Water control |
| Pesticides | Crop protection |
| Result | Asian food security |

## Food and Development

### Caloric Requirements

| Activity | Calories needed |
|----------|-----------------|
| Subsistence | ~2,000/day |
| Heavy labor | 3,000-4,000/day |
| Modern sedentary | 2,000-2,500/day |

### Nutrition and Productivity

| Better nutrition | Effect |
|------------------|--------|
| Height | Increases |
| Cognitive development | Improves |
| Labor productivity | Higher |
| Life expectancy | Longer |

### Food as Development Indicator

| Measure | What it shows |
|---------|---------------|
| Caloric intake | Basic adequacy |
| Protein consumption | Diet quality |
| Meat consumption | Wealth indicator |
| Variety | Development level |

## Modern Food System

### Abundance

| Feature | Character |
|---------|-----------|
| Production | Exceeds global needs |
| Variety | Global, year-round |
| Processing | Convenient, preserved |
| Cost | Declining share of income |

### Continuing Challenges

| Challenge | Reality |
|-----------|---------|
| Hunger | ~800 million undernourished |
| Obesity | Rising, even in developing |
| Distribution | Surplus and shortage coexist |
| Environment | Sustainability concerns |
| Climate | Threatening future production |

### Food Security

| Dimension | Requirement |
|-----------|-------------|
| Availability | Enough produced |
| Access | Can afford/obtain |
| Utilization | Nutritious, safe |
| Stability | Reliable over time |

## The Deeper Point

Food security is the foundation on which all other [[Institutions and Progress|progress]] rests. Without agricultural surplus, no one can specialize in anything except food production. Without surplus labor freed from farms, no cities, no [[Artisanal Economy|artisans]], no merchants, no industrialization. The [[Agricultural Productivity Revolution|agricultural revolutions]]—medieval, British, Green—each freed labor for other activities. Breaking the Malthusian trap required that agricultural productivity grow faster than population—a feat achieved first in Britain, then spreading globally. But food security remains precarious: nearly a billion people remain undernourished while obesity rises elsewhere. Famines persist not because food doesn't exist but because [[Development Economics|institutions]] fail—Sen's insight that famines are entitlement failures, not just production failures. The politics of food—who controls distribution, who has access, who goes hungry—reveals institutional priorities. Democracies rarely have famines because hungry voters matter. Authoritarian systems can starve millions (Soviet Ukraine, Maoist China). Food is the original constraint, and whether societies broke it determined whether they could progress.
