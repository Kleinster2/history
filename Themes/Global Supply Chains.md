# Global Supply Chains

Global supply chains transformed how the world makes things. Instead of producing goods in one place, modern manufacturing fragments production across continents—design in California, components from Taiwan and Korea, assembly in China, shipping through Singapore, sale everywhere. This "unbundling" created efficiency and vulnerability, prosperity and dependence, winners and losers.

## Overview

### What Supply Chains Are

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| Supply chain | All steps from raw material to consumer |
| Global | Spanning multiple countries |
| Fragmentation | Breaking production into stages |
| Coordination | Managing the pieces |

### The Scale

| Measure | Status |
|---------|--------|
| Trade in intermediates | 2/3 of world trade |
| Countries in iPhone | 43 |
| Container ships | 50,000+ at sea |
| Trade/GDP ratio | 50%+ for many countries |

---

## Historical Background

### Before Globalization

| Era | Production |
|-----|------------|
| Craft | One place, one artisan |
| Factory | One place, many workers |
| National | Components and assembly together |

### First Unbundling (1820-1990)

| Pattern | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Production | Concentrated in factories |
| Trade | Final goods |
| Innovation | Steam, then internal combustion |
| Location | Near markets |

### Second Unbundling (1990-Present)

| Pattern | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Production | Fragmented globally |
| Trade | Components, intermediates |
| Innovation | ICT, containerization |
| Location | Cheapest effective place |

## Enabling Technologies

### Containerization

| Innovation | Effect |
|------------|--------|
| Standardized boxes | Load once, transport anywhere |
| McLean (1956) | First container ship |
| Impact | Shipping costs fell 90% |
| Scale | 800 million TEU/year |

### Information Technology

| Technology | Use |
|------------|-----|
| EDI | Electronic data interchange |
| ERP systems | Track inventory, production |
| Communication | Coordinate across time zones |
| Tracking | Know where everything is |

### Transportation

| Mode | Development |
|------|-------------|
| Container ships | Larger, more efficient |
| Air freight | Time-sensitive goods |
| Trucks | Last mile |
| Ports | Automated terminals |

## How Supply Chains Work

### Typical Flow

| Stage | Example (iPhone) |
|-------|------------------|
| Design | California |
| Chips | Taiwan (TSMC) |
| Display | Korea (Samsung) |
| Memory | Japan, Korea |
| Assembly | China (Foxconn) |
| Distribution | Global |

### Coordination Mechanisms

| Mechanism | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Lead firms | Apple, Nike, Walmart |
| Suppliers | Tiered (1st, 2nd, 3rd) |
| Contracts | Specifications, timing |
| Standards | Quality, compliance |

### Just-in-Time

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Minimal inventory | Arrives when needed |
| Efficiency | Reduces waste |
| Fragility | No buffer |
| Toyota origin | Spread globally |

## Geographic Patterns

### Factory Asia

| Country | Role |
|---------|------|
| China | Assembly, increasingly advanced |
| Vietnam | Labor-intensive assembly |
| Taiwan | Semiconductors |
| Korea | Electronics, advanced manufacturing |
| Japan | High-end components |
| Thailand | Autos, hard drives |

### Other Hubs

| Region | Specialization |
|--------|---------------|
| Mexico | Autos, electronics (for US) |
| Eastern Europe | Autos (for EU) |
| India | Pharma, IT services |
| Bangladesh | Garments |

### Why These Places

| Factor | Importance |
|--------|------------|
| Labor costs | Still matter |
| Skills | Increasingly matter |
| Infrastructure | Ports, power, roads |
| Policy | Trade agreements, zones |
| Agglomeration | Suppliers cluster |

---

## Winners and Losers

### Winners

| Beneficiary | Gain |
|-------------|------|
| Consumers | Lower prices |
| Emerging markets | Jobs, technology |
| Lead firms | Higher profits |
| Shareholders | Value captured |
| Logistics firms | New industry |

### Losers

| Loser | Loss |
|-------|------|
| Manufacturing workers (rich countries) | Jobs offshored |
| Some regions | Deindustrialized |
| Environment | Shipping emissions |
| Small producers | Squeezed by buyers |

### The China Shock

| Effect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| US manufacturing | 2-3 million jobs lost |
| Regions | Rust belt devastation |
| Wages | Suppressed |
| Politics | Populist backlash |

---

## Vulnerabilities

### Revealed by Shocks

| Shock | Lesson |
|-------|--------|
| 2011 Japan earthquake | Single-source risk |
| 2011 Thailand floods | Hard drive shortage |
| COVID-19 (2020) | Everything disrupted |
| Suez blockage (2021) | Chokepoint risk |
| Ukraine war (2022) | Energy, food supply |

### Types of Risk

| Risk | Example |
|------|---------|
| Concentration | Taiwan makes 90% of advanced chips |
| Geopolitical | US-China tensions |
| Natural disaster | Earthquake, pandemic |
| Chokepoints | Malacca Strait, Suez |
| Complexity | Can't trace suppliers |

---

## Reshoring and Resilience
