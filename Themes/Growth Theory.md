# Growth Theory

Why do some countries grow rich while others stay poor? This question drove the development of growth theory—formal economic models explaining long-run prosperity. From Solow's insight that capital accumulation alone can't sustain growth, to Romer's recognition that ideas are the ultimate resource, to empirical debates about institutions versus geography, growth theory has shaped how economists think about development. The stakes are enormous: small differences in growth rates compound into vast differences in living standards.

## Overview

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Core question | What drives long-run economic growth? |
| Key concepts | Capital, labor, technology, institutions |
| Evolution | Solow → Endogenous growth → Institutions |
| Debate | What can policy change? |
| Stakes | GDP per capita differences of 50:1 |

## Why Growth Rates Matter

### The Power of Compounding

| Growth Rate | GDP After 100 Years (Starting at 100) |
|-------------|--------------------------------------|
| 0% | 100 |
| 1% | 270 |
| 2% | 724 |
| 3% | 1,922 |
| 4% | 5,050 |

### Historical Growth Rates

| Country | Period | Annual Growth |
|---------|--------|---------------|
| UK (1820-1870) | Industrial Revolution | 1.2% |
| US (1870-1970) | Industrialization | 2.0% |
| Japan (1950-1990) | Catch-up growth | 6.0% |
| China (1980-2020) | Reform era | 9.0% |
| Sub-Saharan Africa (1960-2000) | Stagnation | 0.5% |

## Classical Growth Theory

### Malthusian Model

| Assumption | Implication |
|------------|-------------|
| Fixed land | Diminishing returns |
| Population grows with income | Erases gains |
| Equilibrium | Subsistence living standards |
| For most of history | Accurate description |

### Breaking the Malthusian Trap

| Development | Effect |
|-------------|--------|
| [[Industrial Revolution]] | Productivity outpaced population |
| [[Demographic Transition]] | Fertility fell |
| Technology | Pushed out diminishing returns |
| Result | Sustained per capita growth |

---

## The Solow Model (1956)

### Core Insight

| Element | Role |
|---------|------|
| Capital accumulation | Increases output |
| Diminishing returns | Each unit of capital adds less |
| Steady state | Growth converges to technology rate |
| Implication | Capital alone can't sustain growth |

### Production Function

| Input | Contribution |
|-------|--------------|
| Capital (K) | Physical equipment, structures |
| Labor (L) | Workers, hours |
| Technology (A) | How efficiently inputs combine |
| Y = A × F(K,L) | Output depends on all three |

### Key Predictions

| Prediction | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| Convergence | Poor countries should grow faster |
| Steady state | Countries converge to growth rate = tech progress |
| Saving rate | Affects level, not long-run growth |
| Population growth | Higher population = lower per capita income |

### Empirical Tests

| Finding | Implication |
|---------|-------------|
| Conditional convergence | Countries converge controlling for institutions |
| Unconditional? | Not really—poor countries not catching up |
| Technology differences | Explain most income differences |
| "Solow residual" | Most growth is unexplained TFP |

---

## Total Factor Productivity (TFP)

### What Is TFP?

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Definition | Output not explained by measured inputs |
| Also called | Solow residual, multi-factor productivity |
| Interpretation | Technology, efficiency, organization |
| Problem | "Measure of our ignorance" |

### TFP Differences

| Country | TFP (US = 100) |
|---------|----------------|
| United States | 100 |
| Western Europe | 85-95 |
| Japan | 75 |
| South Korea | 65 |
| China | 45 |
| India | 35 |
| Sub-Saharan Africa | 20-30 |

### What Explains TFP?

| Factor | Evidence |
|--------|----------|
| Institutions | Strong correlation |
| Human capital | Education, health |
| Technology adoption | Distance from frontier |
| Misallocation | Resources in wrong places |
| Geography | Some evidence |

---

## Endogenous Growth Theory

### The Problem with Solow

| Issue | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Technology exogenous | Assumed to grow, not explained |
| No role for policy | Can't affect long-run growth |
| Doesn't match data | R&D, education seem to matter |

### Romer Model (1986, 1990)

| Innovation | Implication |
|------------|-------------|
| Ideas are non-rival | Can be used by everyone simultaneously |
| Increasing returns | Ideas create more ideas |
| R&D investment | Drives technology |
| Policy matters | Subsidize R&D, education |

### Lucas Model (1988)

| Focus | Human Capital |
|-------|---------------|
| Mechanism | Education creates spillovers |
| Implication | Investment in people drives growth |
| Policy | Education spending affects growth |

### Schumpeterian Growth

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Creative destruction | New products destroy old ones |
| Competition | Drives innovation |
| Rents | Reward for innovating |
| Policy | Balance incentives and diffusion |

---

## Institutions and Growth

### The Argument

| Claim | Evidence |
|-------|----------|
| Institutions cause growth | Property rights, rule of law |
| Colonial origins | European settlement patterns |
| Reversal of fortune | Formerly rich colonies now poor |
| Key authors | Acemoglu, Johnson, Robinson |

### Natural Experiments

| Study | Finding |
|-------|---------|
| Korea (North vs. South) | Same culture, different institutions, huge gap |
| Germany (East vs. West) | Same, then diverged, then converged |
| Colonial boundaries | Arbitrary lines, lasting effects |

### Extractive vs. Inclusive

| Institution Type | Characteristics |
|------------------|----------------|
| Extractive | Elite capture, no property rights |
| Inclusive | Broad participation, secure rights |
| Persistence | Institutions are sticky |
| Implication | Development requires institutional reform |

### Critiques

| Criticism | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Reverse causation | Rich countries afford better institutions |
| Geography matters | Sachs: tropics, malaria, landlocked |
| Culture matters | Weber, Landes: values drive behavior |
| Measurement | How to measure "institutions"? |

---

## Geography and Growth

### Geographic Determinism

| Factor | Claimed Effect |
|--------|----------------|
| Latitude | Temperate zones richer |
| Tropics | Disease, soil, climate challenges |
| Landlocked | Trade disadvantages |
| Resources | Curse or blessing? |

### Evidence

| Finding | Interpretation |
|---------|----------------|
| Tropics are poorer | But causation unclear |
| Malaria burden | Correlates with poverty |
| Coastline access | Trade advantage |
| [[Great Divergence]] | Geography or institutions? |

---

## Human Capital

### Components

| Element | Contribution |
|---------|--------------|
| Education | Cognitive skills, knowledge |
| Health | Productivity, longevity |
| Experience | Learning by doing |
| Training | Job-specific skills |

### Education and Growth

| Finding | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Correlation | Strong relationship |
| Causation | Harder to establish |
| Quality vs. quantity | Years of school vs. learning |
| Returns | Individual vs. social |

---

## Growth Accounting

### Decomposition

| Component | US Growth (1948-2019) |
|-----------|----------------------|
| Labor quantity | 0.5% |
| Labor quality | 0.3% |
| Capital | 0.8% |
| TFP | 1.0% |
| **Total** | **2.6%** |

### Interpretation

| Finding | Implication |
|---------|-------------|
| TFP dominates | Technology is key |
| Capital insufficient | Need productivity growth |
| Human capital matters | But hard to measure |

---

## Contemporary Debates

### Secular Stagnation

| Question | Has growth slowed permanently? |
|----------|-------------------------------|
| Evidence | Slower TFP since 1970s |
| Causes | Low-hanging fruit picked? |
| Counter | Mismeasurement, AI coming |

### Convergence

| Question | Will poor countries catch up? |
|----------|------------------------------|
| Evidence | Some did (Asia), many didn't (Africa) |
| Conditional | Need "right" institutions, policies |
| Unconditional | Not automatic |

### Role of Policy

| View | Claim |
|------|-------|
| Institutionalists | Reform governance |
| Geographers | Invest in health, infrastructure |
| Technologists | Promote innovation |
| Skeptics | Growth can't be engineered |

## The Deeper Point

Growth theory confronts a puzzle: small differences in growth rates, sustained over decades, create enormous differences in living standards—yet we can't fully explain why some countries grow and others don't. The progression from Solow (capital) to Romer (ideas) to Acemoglu (institutions) reflects deeper understanding, but also reveals how much remains unknown. The "Solow residual"—the part of growth we can't explain—is still most of the story. This has humbling implications for [[Development Economics]]: if we don't know what causes growth, we can't be confident in our policy prescriptions. The [[Great Divergence]] happened once; whether it can be reversed for the poorest countries depends on understanding something we may not yet understand. The stakes could not be higher: the difference between 1% and 3% growth, sustained for a century, is the difference between modest improvement and transformation.
