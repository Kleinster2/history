# Human Capital

Human capital—the knowledge, skills, and health embodied in people—is the mechanism through which institutional quality compounds across generations. Physical capital depreciates; human capital accumulates, transmits, and builds upon itself. The concept bridges the gap between institutions (which set the rules) and growth (which requires capable people operating within those rules). Every successful development story is ultimately a human capital story: skills beget productivity beget investment in more skills.

## Overview

## The Economics of Human Capital

### Becker's Framework (1964)

| Concept | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| General training | Useful to any employer |
| Specific training | Useful only to current employer |
| The problem | Who pays for general training? |
| Answer | Workers (through lower wages during training) |
| Or | State (through public education) |

### Investment Logic

| Parallel | Human Capital | Physical Capital |
|----------|--------------|-----------------|
| Cost | Tuition, time, foregone earnings | Purchase price |
| Return | Higher wages/productivity | Output |
| Depreciation | Skill obsolescence | Physical decay |
| Risk | Uncertain future demand | Market risk |
| Key difference | Can't be sold or separated from person |

### Returns to Education

| Level | Average Return (global) |
|-------|------------------------|
| Primary | 10-15% per year |
| Secondary | 8-12% per year |
| Tertiary | 10-15% per year |
| Pattern | Highest returns where scarce |
| Diminishing? | Debated (credential inflation) |

### The Underinvestment Problem

| Issue | Logic |
|-------|-------|
| Poaching | Firms train workers; competitors hire them |
| Result | Firms underinvest in general skills |
| Credit constraints | Poor can't borrow for education |
| Externalities | Educated people benefit others (spillovers) |
| Solution | Public education, subsidies, guilds |
| Historical role | States fill the gap |

## Human Capital and Growth

### Endogenous Growth Theory

| Thinker | Contribution |
|---------|--------------|
| Romer (1990) | Ideas are non-rival; human capital produces ideas |
| Lucas (1988) | Human capital externalities drive growth |
| Mankiw, Romer, Weil (1992) | Augmented Solow model with human capital |
| Implication | Human capital → innovation → sustained growth |

### The Virtuous Cycle

| Step | Mechanism |
|------|-----------|
| Good institutions | Protect returns to education |
| Investment in skills | Families spend on schooling |
| Higher productivity | Better-trained workers produce more |
| Demand for better institutions | Educated populace expects rule of law |
| Institutional improvement | Reinforces the cycle |
| Result | Compounding across generations |

### Cross-Country Evidence

| Pattern | Evidence |
|---------|----------|
| Education correlates with growth | Strong, robust |
| Quality matters more than quantity | Test scores > enrollment |
| But causation is complex | Rich countries can afford schools |
| East Asian success | Education investment preceded growth |
| African challenge | Enrollment up, quality lagging |

## Human Capital and the Great Divergence

### Why Europe Pulled Ahead

| Factor | Human Capital Role |
|--------|-------------------|
| Printing press (1450) | Cheap knowledge diffusion |
| Reformation | Literacy for Bible-reading |
| Scientific Revolution | Empirical knowledge valued |
| Universities | Institutional knowledge production |
| Apprenticeship | Practical skill transmission |
| Mokyr's thesis | "Industrial enlightenment"—useful knowledge |

### Why Others Caught Up

| Country | Human Capital Strategy |
|---------|-----------------------|
| [[Meiji Restoration\|Japan (Meiji)]] | Universal education before industrialization |
| [[Asian Tigers\|South Korea]] | Massive education investment (1960s-80s) |
| [[Asian Tigers\|Taiwan]] | Technical education emphasis |
| [[China's Rise\|China]] | University expansion (1990s-2000s) |
| Pattern | Education investment precedes industrial takeoff |

## Forms of Human Capital

### Cognitive Skills

| Type | Role |
|------|------|
| Literacy | Foundation for all other learning |
| Numeracy | Commercial and scientific capability |
| Problem-solving | Innovation, adaptation |
| Critical thinking | Institutional improvement |
| Measurement | Standardized tests (PISA, etc.) |

### Non-Cognitive Skills

| Type | Role |
|------|------|
| Discipline | Factory work, professional reliability |
| Cooperation | Team production |
| Communication | Coordination, management |
| Persistence | Long-term projects |
| Increasingly valued | As routine cognitive work is automated |

### Health as Human Capital

| Dimension | Economic Effect |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Nutrition | Cognitive development, productivity |
| Disease burden | Days lost, early death |
| Life expectancy | Investment horizon |
| Child mortality | Fertility decisions ([[Demographic Transition]]) |
| Historical | Nutrition improvements → productivity gains |

## Institutional Determinants

### What Encourages Human Capital Investment

| Factor | Mechanism |
|--------|-----------|
| [[Property Rights]] | Returns to skill are protected |
| Rule of law | Education pays off predictably |
| Low corruption | Merit, not connections, determines success |
| Social mobility | Effort rewarded regardless of origin |
| Public education | Access regardless of family wealth |
| Gender equality | Double the talent pool |

### What Discourages It

| Factor | Mechanism |
|--------|-----------|
| Expropriation risk | Why invest if state can take? |
| Corruption | Connections > competence |
| Caste/class rigidity | Mobility blocked |
| Conflict | Schools destroyed, brain drain |
| Discrimination | Returns reduced for excluded groups |

## Human Capital and Inequality

### The Great Compression

| Period | Mechanism |
|--------|-----------|
| 1910-1970 | Education expansion reduced skill premium |
| Mass secondary education | Huge supply increase |
| Effect | Wage compression |
| Goldin & Katz | "Race between education and technology" |

### The Great Divergence (Recent)

| Period | Mechanism |
|--------|-----------|
| 1980-present | Technology outpaced education supply |
| College premium | Rose sharply |
| Skill-biased change | Demand for educated workers grew |
| Polarization | Middle-skill jobs hollowed out |
| Result | Education became dividing line |

### Transmission Across Generations

| Mechanism | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| Parental education | Strongest predictor of child education |
| Expectations | Cultural aspiration |
| Resources | Books, tutoring, environment |
| Networks | Access to opportunity |
| [[Economic Persistence\|Florence evidence]] | Advantages compound over centuries |

## The Deeper Point

Human capital is the mechanism through which [[Institutions and Progress|institutional]] quality compounds across generations—the reason why good institutions produce not just immediate incentive effects but accelerating returns over time. A society that protects [[Property Rights|property rights]] and rewards productive [[Entrepreneurship|entrepreneurship]] doesn't just get one generation of growth; it gets parents investing in children's education because they expect those children to operate in a system where skills pay off. Those educated children demand better institutions (accountable government, rule of law, open competition) because they have more to lose from predation—creating a virtuous cycle that the [[Asian Tigers]] rode from poverty to prosperity in a single generation. The human capital paradox—that individual firms underinvest because trained workers can leave—is why states, guilds, and public education systems have always been necessary supplements to market incentives. The [[Guild Economics|medieval guild's]] seven-year apprenticeship wasn't just training; it was an institutional solution to the poaching problem, binding the apprentice long enough for the master to recoup investment. Modern public education serves the same function at societal scale. The deepest implication of human capital theory is that [[Inequality|inequality]] in education *is* inequality in everything else, deferred: today's unequal schooling is tomorrow's unequal income is next generation's unequal opportunity. The [[Economic Persistence|Florence surname data]]—wealth persisting 600 years—isn't mystical; it's human capital (knowledge, networks, expectations) compounding across generations through whatever institutional framework exists.
