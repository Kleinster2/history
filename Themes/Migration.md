# Migration

Migration—the movement of peoples across space—has shaped human history from the first hominin dispersals out of Africa to modern refugee crises. Migrations spread languages, technologies, and genes; they depopulated regions and filled others; they transformed economies through labor supply, skills transfer, and cultural exchange. Understanding migration means understanding how human geography was made and remade.
