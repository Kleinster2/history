# Pound Sterling

The pound sterling dominated global finance from Waterloo (1815) to World War II—the currency of the world's largest empire, backed by the [[Gold Standard]] and the Bank of England. At its peak, over 60% of world trade was invoiced in sterling. Its decline was slow and painful: two world wars drained British wealth, and the Suez Crisis (1956) confirmed what the numbers had shown for decades—sterling's era had passed.

## Origins

### Medieval Roots

## World War II: The End

### Britain Bankrupted

| Cost | Scale |
|------|-------|

## Modern Sterling

### Current Status

| Feature | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| Global reserves | ~4-5% |
| Forex trading | #4 currency |
| Status | Major but not dominant |
| Brexit impact | Uncertain |

### Why Sterling Survived

| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| London finance | Still major center |
| History | Network effects persist |
| Stability | No hyperinflation |
| Liquidity | Deep markets |

## The Decline Pattern

### The Long Lag

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| 1870s | US economy surpasses Britain |
| 1914 | Financial system strained |
| 1931 | Gold standard abandoned |
| 1944 | Dollar formally supreme |
| 1956 | Political reality catches up |

**80+ years** from economic eclipse to currency eclipse.

### Why So Slow?

| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Network effects | Everyone used sterling |
| Infrastructure | Contracts, habits, systems |
| No alternative (initially) | Dollar not ready pre-1914 |
| Empire | Captive market |
| Trust | Accumulated over centuries |

## The Deeper Point

Sterling's decline illustrates that currency dominance outlasts economic dominance—but not forever. Britain lost industrial supremacy around 1870, financial supremacy around 1914, and currency supremacy around 1944-56. The lag was 70-80 years.

The pound also shows that defending an overvalued currency is futile. Churchill's 1925 return to gold at the prewar rate caused a decade of deflation and unemployment, then collapsed anyway in 1931. Markets eventually win.

Finally, sterling demonstrates that decline can be managed. Britain remained prosperous after losing hegemony. The adjustment was painful—Suez was humiliating—but Britain didn't collapse. The lesson for future declining hegemons: accept the transition rather than fight it.
