# EU Economic Integration

The European Union represents the most ambitious experiment in economic integration since the formation of nation-states. From the Coal and Steel Community of 1951 to the euro of 1999, Europeans gradually unified markets, regulations, and eventually currency—all without political union. The project has delivered prosperity and peace but also exposed tensions: between sovereignty and integration, between creditor and debtor nations, between different visions of capitalism. The EU's struggles and successes offer lessons about the possibilities and limits of economic integration.

## The Deeper Point

EU integration demonstrates both the power and limits of economic arrangements without political union. The single market generated genuine gains; the euro may have been premature given incomplete fiscal and banking union. The EU model—technocratic integration, "ever closer union," crisis-driven deepening—worked until it hit distributional politics. When Germany and Greece disagreed about austerity, there was no democratic mechanism to resolve it at the European level. The [[Institutions and Progress\|institutional]] innovation is real: a new form of governance between international organization and federal state. But the euro crisis revealed that monetary union without fiscal union creates intractable conflicts. The COVID response (joint borrowing) and NextGenerationEU may represent a step toward fiscal capacity, or may prove one-off. The EU's future depends on whether integration can become politically legitimate, not just economically efficient. [[Deglobalization]] pressures and great-power competition may force the choice between deeper union and fragmentation.
