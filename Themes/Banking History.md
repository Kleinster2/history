# Banking History

Banking—the business of receiving deposits and making loans—developed to solve fundamental economic problems: how to transfer money safely, how to mobilize savings for investment, how to manage risk. From Mesopotamian temple loans to modern central banks, financial institutions have enabled (and sometimes disrupted) economic development. Banking history illuminates how credit, trust, and state power interacted to create modern economies.
