# Sovereign Wealth Funds

States as investors. Sovereign wealth funds (SWFs)—government-owned investment vehicles managing national savings—have grown to control over $10 trillion in assets. Originally designed to manage resource revenues or trade surpluses, they now shape global capital markets and represent a distinctive form of state capitalism.

## Overview

| Definition | State-owned investment fund |
| Total assets | $10+ trillion (2024) |
| Largest | Norway ($1.4T), China, Abu Dhabi |

## Types of Funds

### By Funding Source

| Type | Source | Examples |
|------|--------|----------|
| Commodity | Resource revenues | Norway, Kuwait, Abu Dhabi |

## The Deeper Point

Sovereign wealth funds represent a distinctive [[Institutions and Progress|institutional]] response to specific economic problems—particularly the challenge of managing resource wealth without succumbing to the [[Resource Curse|resource curse]]. The Norwegian model shows that proper institutional design can convert depletable underground resources into permanent financial wealth.

But SWFs also illustrate the difficulty of designing institutions for long-term purposes in democratic polities. The funds that work best—Norway, Singapore, Kuwait—have specific conditions: broad political consensus, professional management, strong accountability mechanisms. Where these are absent, SWFs become vehicles for patronage, speculation, or political projects.

The geopolitical concerns reveal tensions between economic efficiency and security. Open capital markets benefit from SWF participation—patient, long-term capital that can stabilize markets. But recipient countries worry about strategic assets falling under foreign government control. The resolution requires institution-building at international level: norms, transparency requirements, reciprocity frameworks.

SWFs also challenge simple categories. They're not quite state capitalism (they invest passively abroad) but not private capital either (they answer to governments). They pursue financial returns but sometimes with political side objectives. They're products of globalization but also tools of national strategy. Understanding them requires moving beyond market-versus-state dichotomies toward appreciation of the many forms economic institutions can take.
