# Democracy

Democracy—rule by the people—is one of humanity's great political experiments. Invented in ancient Athens, forgotten for millennia, then reinvented in the modern era, democracy has become the dominant political ideal. Its relationship to economic development is complex: Does democracy cause prosperity, or does prosperity enable democracy? The history of democracy is intertwined with the history of markets, property rights, and economic freedom.
