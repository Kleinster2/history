# Institutional Economics

The tradition the vault embodies—now made explicit. Institutional economics is the vault's theoretical foundation—the claim that institutions channel ambition into production or extraction.

## Two Traditions

### Old Institutional Economics (OIE)

| Thinker | Contribution |
|---------|--------------|
| Thorstein Veblen (1857-1929) | Critique of neoclassical, evolutionary approach |
| John R. Commons (1862-1945) | Legal foundations, transactions |
| Wesley Mitchell (1874-1948) | Business cycles, empirical |
| Clarence Ayres (1891-1972) | Technology vs. ceremony |

### New Institutional Economics (NIE)

| Thinker | Contribution |
|---------|--------------|
| Ronald Coase (1910-2013) | Transaction costs, firm theory |
| Douglass North (1920-2015) | Institutions and economic history |
| Oliver Williamson (1932-2020) | Governance structures |
| Elinor Ostrom (1933-2012) | Commons, collective action |

## Core Concepts

### What Are Institutions?

| Definition | Source |
|------------|--------|
| "Rules of the game" | Douglass North |
| Formal | Laws, constitutions, property rights |
| Informal | Norms, customs, culture |
| Enforcement | Mechanisms that ensure compliance |

### Types of Institutions

| Type | Examples |
|------|----------|
| Political | Constitutions, voting rules, bureaucracies |
| Economic | Property rights, contract law, money |
| Social | Family structures, religious rules, customs |
| Enforcement | Courts, police, social sanctions |

## Transaction Costs

### Coase's Insight

| In a Zero-Cost World | In Reality |
|---------------------|------------|
| Bargaining costless | Negotiation is expensive |
| All trades happen | Many trades don't happen |
| Firms unnecessary | Firms economize on transaction costs |
| Institutions irrelevant | Institutions reduce transaction costs |

### Types of Transaction Costs

| Type | Examples |
|------|----------|
| Search | Finding trading partners |
| Bargaining | Negotiating terms |
| Enforcement | Ensuring compliance |
| Measurement | Assessing quality |
| Protection | Guarding property |

### Why Firms Exist

| Question | Coase's Answer |
|----------|----------------|
| Why not all market transactions? | Some internal coordination cheaper |
| Firm boundaries | Where internal costs exceed market costs |
| Make or buy | Transaction cost comparison |

## Property Rights

### Why They Matter

| Secure Rights | Insecure Rights |
|---------------|-----------------|
| Investment incentive | Why invest if someone takes it? |
| Long time horizon | Short-term focus |
| Trade enabled | Exchange risky |
| Credit possible | Can't collateralize |

### Dimensions of Property Rights

| Dimension | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| Use rights | Can you use the asset? |
| Income rights | Do you get returns? |
| Transfer rights | Can you sell? |
| Exclusion rights | Can you keep others out? |

### Historical Development

| Era | Property Institution |
|-----|---------------------|
| Ancient | Temple, palace, communal |
| Medieval | Feudal, conditional |
| Early Modern | Enclosure, consolidation |
| Modern | Individual, corporate |

## North's Framework

### Institutions and Economic Performance

| Argument | Evidence |
|----------|----------|
| Institutions shape incentives | Different rules → different behavior |
| Path dependence | History constrains choices |
| Ideology matters | Beliefs shape institutions |
| Organizations adapt | But don't always improve institutions |

### Inclusive vs. Extractive

| Inclusive | Extractive |
|-----------|------------|
| Secure property | Insecure, arbitrary |
| Open entry | Restricted access |
| Level playing field | Privileges for elites |
| Creative destruction | Protect incumbents |

### Acemoglu-Robinson Extension

| Work | Contribution |
|------|--------------|
| *Why Nations Fail* (2012) | Inclusive vs. extractive institutions |
| Critical junctures | Moments of institutional change |
| Virtuous/vicious cycles | Institutions reinforce themselves |
| Colonial legacy | [[Reversal of Fortune]] |

## Baumol's Framework

### Productive vs. Unproductive Entrepreneurship

| Type | Activity |
|------|----------|
| Productive | Innovation, trade, efficiency |
| Unproductive | Rent-seeking, litigation, theft |
| Destructive | War, organized crime |

### The Key Insight

| Claim | Evidence |
|-------|----------|
| Entrepreneurs exist everywhere | Human ambition is universal |
| Rules of the game matter | What pays determines what they do |
| Same people, different outcomes | Institutions channel ambition |

### Application to History

| Era | Predominant Entrepreneurship |
|-----|------------------------------|
| Rome (late) | Tax farming, military |
| Medieval Church | Ecclesiastical careers |
| Song China | Examination system, bureaucracy |
| Industrial Britain | Innovation, commerce |

## Ostrom's Contribution

### Beyond State vs. Market

| Orthodox View | Ostrom's Finding |
|---------------|------------------|
| Commons = tragedy | Many commons work |
| Need privatization or state | Communities can self-govern |
| Top-down solutions | Bottom-up can work |

### Design Principles for Commons

| Principle | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| Clear boundaries | Who's in, who's out |
| Congruence | Rules fit local conditions |
| Collective choice | Affected parties decide |
| Monitoring | Participants or accountable monitors |
| Graduated sanctions | Proportional punishment |
| Conflict resolution | Low-cost, local |
| Recognized rights | External authorities don't undermine |
| Nested enterprises | Multiple levels for large systems |

## Applications

### To Economic History

| Question | Institutional Answer |
|----------|---------------------|
| [[Great Divergence]] | European institutions more inclusive |
| [[Why China Didn't Industrialize]] | Merchant subordination, insecure property |
| [[Islamic World Technological Stagnation]] | Waqf, guilds blocked change |
| Colonial development | Extractive vs. settler institutions |

### To Development

| Policy Implication | Application |
|-------------------|-------------|
| Property rights first | Titling programs |
| Contract enforcement | Legal reform |
| Reduce transaction costs | Infrastructure, information |
| Build state capacity | But avoid extraction |

### To Business

| Concept | Application |
|---------|-------------|
| Firm boundaries | Vertical integration decisions |
| Governance structures | Corporate organization |
| Contracts | Relationship-specific investments |
| Franchising | Hybrid forms |

## Critiques

### From Neoclassical

| Critique | Institutional Response |
|----------|----------------------|
| Not formal enough | Formalization possible (Williamson) |
| Institutions are endogenous | Yes, but still causal |
| Hard to measure | Proxies exist |

### From Marxist

| Critique | Challenge |
|----------|-----------|
| Ignores power | Power shapes institutions |
| Ignores class | Who makes the rules? |
| Technocratic | Politics is conflict |
| Reformist | Doesn't challenge capitalism |

### Internal Debates

| Issue | Positions |
|-------|-----------|
| Measurement | What counts as institutions? |
| Causation | Do institutions cause growth or result from it? |
| Change | How do institutions evolve? |
| Culture vs. institutions | Where's the boundary? |

## The Deeper Point

Institutional economics is the vault's theoretical foundation—the claim that [[Institutions and Progress|institutions channel ambition]] into production or extraction. This tradition explains why the same human motivations produce different outcomes in different contexts: medieval Florence and medieval Russia had equally ambitious people, but Florentine institutions rewarded commerce while Russian institutions rewarded service to the prince. The vault applies this insight across history:

- Ancient [[Ancient Commercial Organization|commercial organization]] varied from enabling (Greek metics) to extractive (Egyptian monopolies)
- Medieval [[Medieval Financial Innovation|financial innovation]] required institutional workarounds for usury prohibitions
- Early Modern [[Great Divergence|divergence]] reflected different institutional choices about property, commerce, and innovation
- Modern [[Varieties of Capitalism|varieties of capitalism]] show that multiple institutional configurations can enable prosperity

The institutional economics tradition doesn't claim institutions are the *only* thing that matters—geography, culture, luck all play roles. But it insists that institutions are the *proximate* mechanism through which other factors operate. Coal matters, but institutions determine whether coal gets mined productively or extracted corruptly. Culture matters, but institutions embody cultural values in enforceable rules. Luck matters, but institutions determine whether lucky breaks compound or dissipate. The question is always: do the rules of the game channel human ambition toward creating value or capturing it?
