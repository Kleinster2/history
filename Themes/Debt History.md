# Debt History

Debt is older than money—Mesopotamian grain loans predate coinage by two millennia. Across all periods, debt has served a dual nature: productive (enabling investment beyond current means) and extractive (compounding, dispossessing, enslaving). The institutional challenge in every era is the same: how to permit productive borrowing while preventing debt from becoming a mechanism of permanent dispossession. Every civilization has faced this, and every civilization's answer reveals its deepest values about property, obligation, and social order.

## Overview

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Origin | Mesopotamian grain loans (~3000 BCE) |
| Precedes | Coined money (by 2,000+ years) |
| Dual nature | Enables investment AND enables extraction |
| Universal problem | Compound interest outgrows any economy |
| Institutional responses | Jubilee, bankruptcy, regulation, revolution |

## Ancient Debt

### Mesopotamia: Where It Started

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Form | Grain loans at planting, repaid at harvest |
| Interest | 20-33% (grain); higher for silver |
| Collateral | Land, family members, self |
| Failure | [[Slavery Economics\|Debt slavery]] |
| Records | Cuneiform tablets (thousands survive) |
| Creditors | Temples, palaces, merchants |

### Debt Slavery

| Pattern | Mechanism |
|---------|-----------|
| Bad harvest | Can't repay grain loan |
| Compound interest | Debt grows faster than income |
| Collateral seized | Land lost first |
| Family pledged | Wife, children become servants |
| Self-pledged | Debtor becomes slave |
| Result | Permanent loss of independence |

### The Clean Slate Tradition

| Institution | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| Sumerian amargi | "Return to mother" (freedom from debt) |
| Babylonian misharum | Royal debt cancellation |
| Frequency | Each new king, or when crisis hit |
| Scope | Consumer/agrarian debt (not commercial) |
| Logic | Preserve the tax base and military manpower |
| Graeber's thesis | Debt jubilees predated and inspired Biblical tradition |

### Biblical Debt Laws

| Law | Provision |
|-----|-----------|
| Sabbatical year | Debt release every 7 years |
| Jubilee | Return of land every 50 years |
| Interest ban | No usury among Israelites |
| Purpose | Prevent permanent landlessness |
| Enforcement | Debated (how fully implemented?) |

### Greek and Roman Debt

| Society | Pattern |
|---------|---------|
| Athens (pre-Solon) | Debt slavery endemic |
| Solon's reforms (594 BCE) | Cancelled debts, banned debt slavery |
| Rome | Nexum (debt bondage) abolished 326 BCE |
| Late Republic | Debt crises drove political conflict |
| Catiline conspiracy | Partly a debtors' revolt |
| Caesar | Partial debt relief |

## Medieval Debt

### The Usury Problem

| Religion | Position |
|----------|----------|
| Christianity | Interest banned (Council of Nicaea, 325) |
| Islam | Riba (interest) prohibited |
| Judaism | No interest among Jews; permitted to outsiders |
| Effect | Credit needed but morally condemned |

### Usury Workarounds

| Device | Mechanism |
|--------|-----------|
| [[Medieval Financial Innovation\|Bills of exchange]] | Profit on exchange, not interest |
| Census (annuity) | Buy right to income stream |
| Societas (partnership) | Share risk for return |
| Fictitious sale | Buy back at higher price |
| Jewish lending | Permitted to Christians |
| Lombard bankers | Italian merchant-lending |

### Sovereign Debt Emerges

| Borrower | Creditor | Purpose |
|----------|----------|---------|
| English crown | Italian bankers | War (Hundred Years' War) |
| Florentine state | Forced loans (prestanze) | War, defense |
| Venetian state | Monte Vecchio (1262) | Funded debt |
| Spanish crown | Genoese bankers | Empire |
| Pattern | States borrow for war; default frequently |

### Medieval Defaults

| Sovereign | Date | Victim |
|-----------|------|--------|
| Edward III of England | 1340s | Bardi, Peruzzi (destroyed) |
| Spanish crown | 1557, 1575, 1596, 1607 | Genoese bankers |
| French crown | Repeatedly | Various |
| Pattern | Kings borrow, then repudiate |
| Lesson | Sovereign debt without constitutional constraint |

## Early Modern Debt

### The Dutch Innovation

| Feature | Significance |
|---------|--------------|
| [[Dutch Golden Age\|Holland's funded debt]] | Permanent debt, regular interest |
| Low interest rates | 3-4% (vs. 10%+ elsewhere) |
| Why so low? | Parlamentary control, credible commitment |
| Bond market | Tradeable government debt |
| Key insight | Constitutional constraint → lower borrowing costs |

### The English Financial Revolution (1690s)

| Innovation | Effect |
|------------|--------|
| Bank of England (1694) | Government's banker |
| National Debt | Permanent, funded, managed |
| Parliamentary guarantee | Creditors trust the state |
| Low interest | Fell to 3% by 1750s |
| Military advantage | Could outspend France |
| Connection | Debt-funded war → empire → more revenue |

### The Debt-State Nexus

| Pattern | Logic |
|---------|-------|
| War requires borrowing | Taxes insufficient for peaks |
| Creditors require constraint | Will lend cheaply only if confident of repayment |
| Constraint requires parliament | Representative bodies guarantee debt |
| Result | Debt markets drove constitutional development |
| Stasavage's thesis | "States of Credit"—creditworthiness built democracy |

## Modern Debt

### Sovereign Debt in the Industrial Age

| Period | Character |
|--------|-----------|
| Napoleonic Wars | Massive British borrowing (250% of GDP by 1815) |
| 19th century | Latin American defaults (1820s, 1870s, 1890s) |
| WWI | War debts, reparations |
| Interwar | Debt deflation, defaults |
| Post-WWII | Financial repression reduced ratios |
| 1970s-80s | Developing world debt crises |

### Consumer Debt Revolution

| Development | Date | Effect |
|-------------|------|--------|
| Installment buying | 1920s | Automobiles, appliances |
| Credit cards | 1950s | Universal consumer credit |
| Mortgage expansion | 1930s-2000s | Homeownership |
| Securitization | 1980s | Debt as tradeable asset |
| Student loans | 1960s+ | Education financing |

### The 2008 Crisis

| Factor | Role |
|--------|------|
| Mortgage debt | Expanded to uncreditworthy borrowers |
| Securitization | Risk obscured, distributed |
| Leverage | Banks highly leveraged |
| Contagion | Interconnected debt markets |
| Result | [[2008 Financial Crisis\|Global financial crisis]] |
| Lesson | Debt innovations create new fragilities |

### Sovereign Debt Today

| Country | Debt/GDP (2023) |
|---------|-----------------|
| Japan | ~260% |
| US | ~120% |
| China | ~80% (much more including local) |
| Average advanced economy | ~110% |
| Question | How much is sustainable? |
| MMT view | Sovereign issuers can't default (own currency) |
| Orthodox view | Debt burdens future growth |

## Debt Crises: The Pattern

### Reinhart & Rogoff (2009)

| Finding | Evidence |
|---------|----------|
| "This time is different" | Perennial self-deception |
| 800 years of crises | Consistent pattern |
| Overconfidence | Borrowers and lenders both |
| Default rate | Regular, predictable |
| After crises | Recovery takes 5-10 years |

### The Debt Cycle

| Stage | Character |
|-------|-----------|
| Recovery | Confidence returns, lending resumes |
| Expansion | Credit grows faster than income |
| Euphoria | Everyone borrows, standards fall |
| Crisis | Defaults begin, contagion |
| Contraction | Deleveraging, recession |
| Repeat | "This time is different" |

### Debt Resolution Methods

| Method | Example |
|--------|---------|
| Repayment | Rare (usually impossible at scale) |
| Default | Outright repudiation |
| Restructuring | Extend terms, reduce amount |
| Inflation | Erode real value |
| Financial repression | Force savers to lend cheaply |
| Growth | Outgrow the debt (rare) |
| Jubilee | Cancel it (ancient, sometimes modern) |

---

## The Institutional Design Problem

### Productive Debt

| Use | Example |
|-----|---------|
| Investment | Factory, education, infrastructure |
| Smoothing | Bridge temporary shortfall |
| Risk-sharing | Spread losses |
| Enabling | Do now what income permits later |
| Growth | Lever limited capital |

### Extractive Debt

| Problem | Mechanism |
|---------|-----------|
| Compound interest | Grows faster than any economy |
| Dispossession | Collateral seized |
| Debt peonage | Permanent subordination |
| Predatory lending | Lend knowing borrower will fail |
| Colonial debt | Imposed obligations |

### Institutional Solutions Through History

| Era | Solution |
|-----|----------|
| Mesopotamia | Royal jubilee (misharum) |
| Biblical | 7-year sabbatical, 50-year jubilee |
| Athens | Solon's seisachtheia |
| Medieval | Usury prohibition (limited interest) |
| Modern | Bankruptcy law (limited liability for failure) |
| 20th century | Central bank as lender of last resort |
| Debated | Universal basic income, debt cancellation |

### Bankruptcy: The Modern Jubilee

| Feature | Function |
|---------|----------|
| Limited liability | Corporate failure without personal ruin |
| Chapter 11 (US) | Reorganization, not liquidation |
| Consumer bankruptcy | Fresh start |
| Economic function | Encourages risk-taking (failure isn't permanent) |
| Historical innovation | 18th-19th century development |
| Connection to [[Entrepreneurship]] | Bankruptcy tolerance enables startups |

## The Deeper Point

Debt institutions reveal the deepest tension in any economy: the same mechanism that enables productive ambition (borrow now, invest, repay from returns) also enables permanent dispossession (compound interest outgrows any income stream, transferring assets from borrowers to creditors inexorably). Every civilization has faced this, and their responses define their institutional character. Mesopotamian kings cancelled debts to preserve their military tax base—a pragmatic [[Institutions and Progress|institutional]] choice that prioritized social stability over creditor rights. Athens' Solon cancelled debts and banned debt slavery to preserve the citizen body—choosing democracy over contract enforcement. Modern bankruptcy law performs the same function: by limiting the consequences of failure, it channels [[Entrepreneurship|entrepreneurial]] ambition toward risk-taking rather than risk-avoidance. The [[Dutch Golden Age|Dutch]] and English innovations in sovereign debt show the opposite face: by making debt *credible* through parliamentary guarantee, they enabled states to borrow cheaply for productive investment (and war), creating a fiscal-military advantage that built empires. The [[2008 Financial Crisis]] revealed what happens when debt [[Innovation Economics|innovation]] outpaces institutional constraint: securitization democratized credit (productive) while obscuring risk (extractive), until the system collapsed. The pattern is always the same: debt enables growth until it enables crisis, and the question is never whether to permit debt (every society does) but how to design institutions that channel it toward investment rather than dispossession—the Baumol problem applied to finance.
