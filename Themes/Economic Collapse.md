# Economic Collapse

Every ancient economic system eventually ended—some through gradual transformation, others through sudden collapse. Understanding why systems fail reveals what makes economies fragile and what factors might threaten any economic system, including our own.

## The Record

### Major Economic Collapses

| System | Peak | Collapse | Severity |
|--------|------|----------|----------|
| Indus Valley | 2600-1900 BCE | ~1900 BCE | Total (cities abandoned) |
| Bronze Age Mediterranean | 1400 BCE | ~1200 BCE | Catastrophic (multiple civilizations) |
| Western Rome | 1st-2nd c. CE | 3rd-5th c. CE | Gradual then rapid |
| Maya (Classic) | 600-800 CE | 800-1000 CE | Regional (lowlands) |
| Inca | 1500 CE | 1533 | Sudden (conquest) |

### Systems That Transformed

| System | Transformation | Result |
|--------|----------------|--------|
| Mesopotamia | Multiple conquests | Cultural continuity |
| Egypt | Conquest cycles | Absorbed into Rome |
| China | Dynastic cycles | Institutional continuity |
| Persia | Conquest cycles | Cultural persistence |

## Causes of Collapse

### 1. Environmental Factors

**Climate Change**

| Collapse | Climate Factor |
|----------|----------------|

| Maya | Population collapse |
| Post-Columbian Americas | 90% mortality |

**Migration/Invasion**

| System | Migration Factor |
|--------|------------------|
| Rome | "Barbarian" migrations |
| Bronze Age | Sea Peoples |
| Various | Steppe nomad incursions |

### 5. Systemic Fragility

**Complexity Collapse (Tainter)**

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Rising complexity | Solutions create new problems |
| Diminishing returns | More investment, less benefit |
| Collapse as simplification | Shedding complexity |

**Network Failure**

| System | Network Problem |
|--------|-----------------|
| Bronze Age | Interconnected collapse |
| Indus | Trade network breakdown |
| Rome | Supply chain collapse |

## Case Studies

### The Indus Valley Collapse (~1900 BCE)

| Factor | Evidence |
|--------|----------|
| Climate | Monsoon weakening |
| Rivers | Ghaggar-Hakra dried |
| Trade | Network disruption |
| Unknown | Much still mysterious |

**What Happened:**
- Cities abandoned
- Standardization ended
- Population dispersed
- Writing disappeared
- No conquest evidence

**Lesson:** Even sophisticated systems can collapse without external conquest.

### The [[Bronze Age Collapse]] (~1200 BCE)

| Factor | Evidence |
|--------|----------|
| Invasion | Sea Peoples |
| Trade disruption | Tin supply? |
| Climate | Drought evidence |
| Internal | State weakness |
| Systemic | Interconnected failure |

**What Collapsed:**
- Mycenaean Greece
- Hittite Empire
- Egyptian New Kingdom (weakened)
- Ugarit and Levantine cities
- Cyprus disrupted

**Lesson:** Interconnected systems can fail together.

### Roman Economic Decline

| Period | Indicators |
|--------|------------|
| 1st-2nd c. | Prosperity |
| 3rd c. | Currency collapse, fragmentation |
| 4th c. | Partial recovery, increasing controls |
| 5th c. (West) | Collapse |

**Factors:**

| Factor | Role |
|--------|------|
| Currency | Severe debasement |
| Military costs | Unsustainable |
| Tax flight | Elites escaped |
| Trade contraction | Long-distance declined |
| Plague | Population loss |
| Invasions | Continuous pressure |
| Political | Civil wars, instability |

**Lesson:** Multiple factors can reinforce each other.

### Maya Collapse (800-1000 CE)

| Factor | Evidence |
|--------|----------|
| Drought | Severe, prolonged |
| Warfare | Intensified |
| Deforestation | Environmental degradation |
| Elite extraction | Monuments over sustainability |
| Population | Exceeded carrying capacity |

**What Happened:**
- Classic lowland cities abandoned
- Population declined 90%+
- Northern and highland Maya continued
- Not total civilizational collapse

**Lesson:** Regional collapse within continuing civilization.

### Inca Collapse (1533)

| Factor | Role |
|--------|------|
| Conquest | 168 Spaniards + allies |
| Disease | Smallpox preceded conquest |
| Civil war | Succession conflict |
| Technology | Steel, horses, guns |
| Capture of ruler | Atahualpa seized |

**What Was Lost:**
- Redistribution system
- Mit'a (transformed into colonial exploitation)
- Khipu knowledge (much lost)
- Alternative economic model

**Lesson:** External conquest can destroy functional systems.

## Patterns Across Collapses

### Common Features

| Pattern | Frequency |
|---------|-----------|
| Multiple causes | Always |
| Elite failure | Common |
| Environmental stress | Common |
| Fiscal crisis | Common |
| Trade disruption | Common |
| Population decline | Common |

### Warning Signs

| Indicator | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| Currency debasement | Fiscal desperation |
| Increasing extraction | Diminishing returns |
| Elite flight | Abandoning system |
| Infrastructure decay | Can't maintain |
| Trade contraction | Network weakening |
| Population decline | System failing people |

### Recovery Patterns

| Pattern | Example |
|---------|---------|
| Simplification | Post-Roman Europe |
| Transformation | Egypt into Rome |
| Absorption | Conquered states |
| Continuation elsewhere | Maya highlands |
| Complete loss | Indus civilization |

## What Makes Systems Resilient?

### Factors That Help

| Factor | Mechanism |
|--------|-----------|
| Diversity | Not single point of failure |
| Flexibility | Can adapt to shocks |
| Reserves | Buffer against crisis |
| Legitimacy | People support system |
| Moderate extraction | Sustainable |
| Environmental sustainability | Resource base intact |

### Factors That Hurt

| Factor | Risk |
|--------|------|
| Over-complexity | Fragile |
| Over-extraction | Exhaustion |
| Over-centralization | Single point of failure |
| Inequality | Instability |
| Environmental degradation | Undermines foundation |
| Rigidity | Can't adapt |

## Implications

### For Understanding History

| Lesson | Implication |
|--------|-------------|
| All systems end | None is permanent |
| Multiple causes | No single explanation |
| Contingency matters | Not deterministic |
| Recovery varies | From total loss to transformation |

### For the Present

| Ancient Pattern | Modern Parallel? |
|-----------------|------------------|
| Currency debasement | Monetary expansion |
| Environmental stress | Climate change |
| Over-complexity | System fragility |
| Inequality | Growing concentration |
| Trade dependence | Globalization |

**Not prediction—observation of patterns.**

**Counterexample:** The [[Timber Crisis]] shows resource constraint can drive innovation rather than collapse—Britain's wood shortage pushed coal adoption, enabling industrialization.

## The Deeper Point

Tainter's thesis—that collapse is the rational response to declining returns on complexity—reframes collapse from failure to adaptation. Societies don't collapse because they're poorly run; they collapse because the [[Institutions and Progress|institutional]] complexity that once solved problems starts costing more than it provides. [[Roman Economy|Rome]] didn't fall because of barbarians; it fell because maintaining the legions, the roads, the bureaucracy, and the borders cost more than the tax base could sustain—and simpler alternatives (local warlords) provided adequate security more cheaply. The [[Bronze Age Collapse]] didn't happen because of Sea Peoples; it happened because the palace-economy networks connecting Egypt, Hatti, Mycenae, and Ugarit were fragile to *any* disruption of the trade that sustained them. The pattern across all collapses: complex institutions enable growth but create systemic risk. The more interconnected the system, the more a local failure cascades into system-wide breakdown. This is exactly the [[2008 Financial Crisis|2008]] lesson applied to antiquity—and it suggests that our own institutional complexity, while enabling unprecedented [[Innovation Economics|prosperity]], may be approaching similar thresholds of fragility. The question isn't whether complex systems can collapse—they always can—but whether our institutions are adaptive enough to simplify before they shatter.
