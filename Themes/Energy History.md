# Energy History

Energy—the capacity to do work—underlies all economic activity. Human history can be read through energy transitions: from human muscle to animal power, from wood to coal, from coal to oil, from fossil fuels to renewables. Each transition transformed economies, societies, and environments. Understanding energy history illuminates both past development and future challenges.

## Overview

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Definition | Capacity for work |
| Role | Economic foundation |
| Transitions | Progressive intensification |
| Pattern | Increasing consumption |
| Challenge | Sustainability |

## Energy Eras

### Somatic Era (Pre-Agriculture)

| Source | Character |
|--------|-----------|
| Human muscle | Primary |
| Food calories | Energy basis |
| Fire | First external energy |
| Efficiency | Limited |

### Agricultural Era

| Source | Role |
|--------|------|
