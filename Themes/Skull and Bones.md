# Skull and Bones

Skull and Bones is Yale's oldest secret society and America's most famous elite network—a membership of roughly 800 living members that has produced three presidents, countless cabinet secretaries, CIA directors, Supreme Court justices, and the partners of every major Wall Street firm. Founded in 1832, the society taps fifteen Yale seniors each year for lifetime membership in a fraternity whose actual activities matter far less than its function as a selection and bonding mechanism for the American establishment. Bonesmen didn't conspire to rule America; they simply knew each other, trusted each other, and hired each other—which in practice amounted to the same thing.

## The Deeper Point

Skull and Bones matters not because of its rituals but because of what it reveals about American establishment formation. The society didn't create the elite—it selected from it, bonded it, and perpetuated it. A fifteen-person senior class, chosen for already being campus leaders from connected families, formed relationships that lasted lifetimes and determined careers.

The Harriman-Bush-[[Brown Brothers Harriman]] nexus is Bones made institutional. Averell Harriman (1913), Roland Harriman (1917), Prescott Bush (1917), and Robert Lovett (1918) weren't just Yale classmates—they were Bonesmen who trusted each other with the absolute loyalty the society cultivated. When they formed a banking partnership and then moved between Wall Street and Washington, they drew on bonds forged in "The Tomb" decades earlier.

The [[Institutions and Progress|institutional]] function is selection plus trust. Yale identified talented, ambitious young men from established families. Bones identified the most promising among them. The society's rituals—whatever they were—created intense peer bonds. Those bonds became the basis for business partnerships, government appointments, and social connections that persisted for fifty years. You didn't need conspiracy when you had a network of people who'd known and trusted each other since age twenty-one.

That three generations of Bushes were Bonesmen, that both 2004 presidential candidates were Bonesmen, that the firm that produced cabinet secretaries and senators was staffed by Bonesmen—these facts don't prove conspiracy. They prove that elite reproduction in America ran through specific institutions: prep schools, Yale, Skull and Bones, Wall Street partnerships, government service, and back again. The machinery was hidden in plain sight.
