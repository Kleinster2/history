# Keynesian Economics

The framework for understanding macroeconomic management. Keynesian economics institutionalized state intervention in markets—the question is whether intervention channels or distorts ambition.

## Origins

### The Great Depression Context

| Observation | Orthodox Failure |
|-------------|------------------|
| 25% unemployment (US, 1933) | "Markets self-correct" |
| Deflation | "Wait for prices to fall" |
| Bank failures | "Let weak banks fail" |
| Years of stagnation | Theory said impossible |

### Keynes's Intervention

| Work | Contribution |
|------|--------------|
| *Treatise on Money* (1930) | Monetary theory |
| *General Theory* (1936) | Revolutionary framework |
| Policy advocacy | Active government role |

## Core Ideas

### Aggregate Demand

| Component | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| Consumption (C) | Household spending |
| Investment (I) | Business spending |
| Government (G) | Public spending |
| Net exports (X-M) | Trade balance |
| Y = C + I + G + (X-M) | National income identity |

### The Problem

| Classical View | Keynesian View |
|----------------|----------------|
| Supply creates demand (Say's Law) | Demand can fall short |
| Savings = Investment (always) | Savings can exceed investment |
| Full employment normal | Unemployment equilibrium possible |
| Wages adjust | Wages are sticky |

### Key Mechanisms

| Concept | Mechanism |
|---------|-----------|
| Multiplier | $1 spending → >$1 income |
| Marginal propensity to consume | Fraction of income spent |
| Liquidity preference | Demand for money |
| Animal spirits | Business confidence |
| Paradox of thrift | Saving can harm economy |

## The Multiplier

### How It Works

| Round | Process |
|-------|---------|
| Initial | Government spends $100 |
| First round | Recipients spend $80 (MPC = 0.8) |
| Second round | Those recipients spend $64 |
| Continuing | Each round smaller |
| Total | $100 → $500 (multiplier = 5) |

### Formula

| Element | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Multiplier | 1/(1-MPC) |
| If MPC = 0.8 | Multiplier = 5 |
| If MPC = 0.5 | Multiplier = 2 |

## Policy Implications

### Fiscal Policy

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Recession | Increase government spending |
| Inflation | Reduce spending, raise taxes |
| Unemployment | Deficit spending acceptable |
| Depression | Massive stimulus |

### Monetary Policy

| Tool | Effect |
|------|--------|
| Interest rates | Lower → more investment |
| Liquidity trap | At zero, monetary policy ineffective |
| Money supply | Affects through interest rates |

### The New Role of Government

| Function | Justification |
|----------|---------------|
| Stabilization | Counter business cycles |
| Automatic stabilizers | Unemployment insurance, progressive taxes |
| Discretionary policy | Active response to conditions |
| Demand management | Prevent depressions |

## Post-War Consensus (1945-1973)

### Bretton Woods Era

| Feature | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| Fixed exchange rates | International stability |
| Capital controls | Domestic policy autonomy |
| Welfare states | Automatic stabilizers |
| Full employment goal | Policy commitment |

### The Golden Age

| Indicator | Performance |
|-----------|-------------|
| Growth | 4-5% annually (OECD) |
| Unemployment | Low, stable |
| Inflation | Moderate |
| Crises | Few, contained |

### "We Are All Keynesians Now"

| Evidence | Manifestation |
|----------|---------------|
| Nixon (1971) | Republican president, Keynesian policy |
| Bipartisan consensus | Both parties accepted framework |
| Economic management | Accepted government role |

## The Monetarist Challenge

### Friedman's Critique

| Argument | Implication |
|----------|-------------|
| Long and variable lags | Policy destabilizing |
| Expectations matter | Phillips curve shifts |
| Inflation is monetary | Central banks responsible |
| Rules over discretion | Limit policy flexibility |

### Stagflation (1970s)

| Problem | Challenge to Keynesianism |
|---------|---------------------------|
| High inflation + unemployment | Shouldn't happen together |
| Oil shocks | Supply-side problem |
| Expectations | Inflation became self-fulfilling |
| Phillips curve breakdown | Trade-off disappeared |

## New Classical Revolution

### Rational Expectations

| Concept | Implication |
|---------|-------------|
| Forward-looking agents | Anticipate policy |
| Policy ineffectiveness | Systematic policy has no real effect |
| Lucas critique | Past relationships don't hold |
| Microfoundations | Macro must derive from micro |

### Real Business Cycle Theory

| Claim | Interpretation |
|-------|----------------|
| Fluctuations are optimal | Response to real shocks |
| No market failure | Government intervention harmful |
| Technology shocks | Main driver of cycles |

## New Keynesian Synthesis

### Incorporating Critiques

| From New Classical | Retained from Keynes |
|--------------------|----------------------|
| Rational expectations | Sticky prices/wages |
| Microfoundations | Market imperfections |
| Forward-looking behavior | Demand matters |
| Dynamic models | Policy effectiveness |

### Contemporary Framework

| Feature | Role |
|---------|------|
| DSGE models | Dynamic stochastic general equilibrium |
| Monetary policy rules | Taylor rule |
| Inflation targeting | Price stability focus |
| Independent central banks | Credibility |

## Post-2008 Revival

### Crisis Response

| Policy | Scale |
|--------|-------|
| Fiscal stimulus | Trillions globally |
| Quantitative easing | Central bank asset purchases |
| Zero interest rates | Liquidity trap again |
| Deficit acceptance | Austerity debates |

### Renewed Debates

| Question | Controversy |
|----------|-------------|
| Austerity vs. stimulus | European experiment |
| Secular stagnation | Persistent low demand |
| Fiscal multipliers | How large? Context-dependent? |
| Modern Monetary Theory | Radical Keynesian extension |

## Limits and Critiques

### From the Right

| Critique | Argument |
|----------|----------|
| Government failure | Politicians can't manage well |
| Crowding out | Public spending displaces private |
| Inflation risk | Deficit spending → inflation |
| Debt burden | Future generations pay |

### From the Left

| Critique | Argument |
|----------|----------|
| Insufficient | Doesn't address structural inequality |
| Supports capitalism | Saves system from itself |
| Ignores power | Distribution not addressed |
| Environmental blind | Growth orientation |

### Institutional Perspective

| Gap | Problem |
|-----|---------|
| Institution-blind | Assumes policy implementation works |
| One-size-fits-all | Context matters |
| State capacity assumed | Many states can't execute |
| Political economy ignored | Who decides policy? |

## The Deeper Point

Keynesian economics institutionalized state intervention in markets—creating the expectation that governments would manage demand, prevent depressions, and maintain employment. This was itself an [[Institutions and Progress|institutional change]]—a new role for the state, new policy tools, new expectations. The question is whether this intervention channels ambition productively (by preventing waste of idle resources during recessions) or distorts it (by creating moral hazard, inflation, or political capture of economic policy). The answer depends on [[State Capacity|institutional quality]]—Keynesian policies work differently in states that can implement them competently versus those that can't. The framework's revival after 2008 shows its continued relevance, but the institutional conditions for effective Keynesian policy—competent bureaucracies, credible commitments, political will—are themselves historical achievements, not universal givens.
