# Accounting History

Accounting is the institutional infrastructure that makes modern business possible. Without reliable numbers, there are no [[Stock Markets|stock markets]], no external investors, no corporations with dispersed ownership. Double-entry bookkeeping, invented in medieval Italy and codified by Pacioli in 1494, was the first great accounting innovation; professional auditing, developed in 19th-century Britain, was the second. Each solved the same fundamental problem: how can people trust the financial claims of strangers? Accounting failures—from railroad frauds to Enron—repeatedly demonstrate what happens when that trust is misplaced.

## Overview

## The Deeper Point

Accounting is the institutional infrastructure that makes [[Business Firm|business enterprise]] at scale possible. The fundamental problem is trust: how can investors, creditors, and partners trust the financial claims of strangers? Without accounting, business is limited to what principals can personally observe—family firms, partnerships, local enterprises. With reliable accounting—double-entry bookkeeping that balances, auditing that verifies, standards that ensure comparability—strangers can pool capital for enterprises they never visit, trusting that the numbers are real. This is why Pacioli's codification of double-entry in 1494 was as important to capitalism as any invention: it created the information infrastructure for the [[East India Companies|joint-stock company]], the [[Stock Markets|stock market]], the dispersed ownership corporation. The recurring scandals (Enron, WorldCom, Wirecard) demonstrate that accounting trust is never permanent—[[Entrepreneurship|entrepreneurial]] talent flows toward exploiting the gaps between what numbers show and what reality is. But the scandals also demonstrate institutional resilience: each crisis produces reform (Sarbanes-Oxley, PCAOB, new standards) that plugs the gap, at least temporarily. The deeper insight: accounting is not a neutral mirror of reality but an institutional construction that determines what gets measured, valued, and managed. The shift from historical cost to fair value, the inclusion of intangibles, the emergence of ESG reporting—each changes what business is incentivized to do. [[State Capacity|State capacity]] to enforce accounting standards is the hidden variable: the same GAAP applied in countries with weak audit cultures produces different outcomes than in countries with strong ones.
