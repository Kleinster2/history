# Real Estate and Housing

Real estate is the world's largest asset class—worth more than all stocks and bonds combined. Housing is both consumption (shelter) and investment (wealth building), creating inherent tensions. The 20th century saw homeownership become central to middle-class identity and wealth accumulation, especially in the US and UK. The 21st century has seen housing become unaffordable in global cities, contributing to the [[Post-2008 Economy|2008 financial crisis]], widening [[Inequality]], and reshaping politics. The housing question is now central to economic policy.

## Overview

|---------|-------------|
| Asset value | ~$330 trillion globally |
| Share of household wealth | 50-70% in most countries |
| As consumption | Basic need, shelter |
| As investment | Wealth building, speculation |
| Key tension | Affordability vs. asset appreciation |

## The Affordability Crisis

|---------|------------------------|-------------------|
| US | +150% | +60% |
| UK | +180% | +50% |
| Canada | +250% | +55% |
| Australia | +220% | +65% |

### Affordability Metrics

| Metric | Historically Normal | Current (Many Markets) |
|--------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| Price/income | 3-4x | 7-12x |
| Rent/income | 25-30% | 40-50% |
| First-time buyer age | 28-30 | 35-40 |

### Geographic Variation

| Market Type | Affordability |
|-------------|---------------|
| Global cities (NYC, London, Sydney) | Severely unaffordable |
| Tech hubs (SF, Seattle) | Crisis level |
| Midwest US cities | Still affordable |
| Second-tier cities | Worsening |

---

## Causes of Unaffordability

### Supply Constraints

| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Zoning restrictions | Limit density, housing types |
| NIMBYism | Residents block new construction |
| Construction costs | Labor, materials, regulation |
| Land scarcity | Desirable locations limited |
| Historic preservation | Restricts development |

### Demand Drivers

| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Population growth | More households |
| Immigration | Concentrated in metros |
| Urbanization | Rural to urban shift |
| Household formation | More single-person households |
| Investment demand | Housing as asset |

### Financial Factors

| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Low interest rates | [[ZIRP Era]] inflated prices |
| Mortgage availability | More buyers = higher prices |
| Institutional investors | Competing with households |
| Foreign capital | Safe haven investment |

### Policy Failures

| Policy | Unintended Consequence |
|--------|------------------------|
| Mortgage interest deduction | Subsidizes expensive homes |
| Capital gains exclusion | Encourages holding |
| Property tax limits (Prop 13) | Reduces turnover |
| Rent control | Reduces supply long-term |

## The Deeper Point

Housing sits at the intersection of every major economic question: [[Inequality]] (wealth gap between owners and renters), [[Urbanization]] (where people live and work), [[Banking History\|finance]] (mortgages as bank assets), [[State Capacity\|policy]] (zoning, subsidies, regulation), and [[Demographic Transition\|demographics]] (household formation, aging). The fundamental tension is that existing homeowners benefit from rising prices while aspiring owners suffer. This creates a political economy that blocks solutions: homeowners vote, and they vote against anything that might reduce their home values. The result is a system where housing—which should become more abundant as societies get richer—instead becomes scarcer and more expensive. The [[ZIRP Era]] supercharged this: low rates increased what buyers could bid, flowing directly into prices rather than affordability. Countries that managed housing differently (Vienna, Singapore, Japan) show alternatives exist, but they require political choices that Anglo-American systems have been unwilling to make. Housing may be the single most important determinant of economic welfare for most households, yet economic policy has largely failed to ensure adequate supply.
