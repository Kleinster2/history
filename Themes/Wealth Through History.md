# Wealth Through History

What does it mean to be rich? The answer has changed dramatically across human history—from cattle and grain, to land and gold, to capital and financial assets. Examining wealth reveals who held power, how economies actually functioned, and the vast inequalities that characterized most human societies. The super-rich were not just beneficiaries of their economies but active shapers of history.

## What Counted as Wealth

### The Evolution of Wealth Forms

| Era | Primary Wealth | Secondary Wealth |
|-----|----------------|------------------|
| Prehistoric | Cattle, stored grain | Tools, ornaments |
| Ancient | Land, slaves, bullion | Trade goods |
| Medieval | Land, rents | Merchandise, loans |
| Early Modern | Land, trade capital | Financial instruments |
| Industrial | Industrial capital | Land, finance |
| Modern | Financial assets | Real estate, equity |

### Why It Changed

| Shift | Driver |
|-------|--------|
| Land → Trade | Commercial revolution |
| Bullion → Credit | Banking development |
| Land → Capital | Industrial Revolution |
| Physical → Financial | 20th century finance |

## Measuring Wealth Across Time

### The Comparison Problem

| Challenge | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Different currencies | Talents, denarii, florins, pounds |
| Different prices | What could money buy? |
| Different economies | Subsistence vs. market |
| Different assets | Land vs. capital |
| Inflation | Nominal vs. real |

### Common Approaches

| Method | Description | Limitation |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| Gold equivalent | Convert to gold weight | Gold's value changed |
| Labor days | How many workers' annual wages | Labor value varied |
| GDP share | Percentage of economy | GDP estimates uncertain |
| Purchasing power | What it could buy | Baskets differ |

### Comparative Wealth (Very Rough Estimates)

| Individual | Period | Estimated Wealth | Modern Equivalent |

## Wealth Concentration

### Inequality Through History

| Period | Pattern |
|--------|---------|
| Hunter-gatherer | Relatively equal |
| Agricultural | Highly unequal |
| Ancient empires | Extreme at top |
| Medieval | High, land-based |
| Early modern | High, diversifying |
| Industrial (early) | Increasing |
| Industrial (late) | Decreasing (in West) |
| Late 20th c. | Decreasing then increasing |

### Gini Coefficients (Rough Estimates)

| Society | Gini (0=equal, 1=unequal) |
|---------|---------------------------|
| Hunter-gatherers | 0.2-0.3 |
| Roman Empire | 0.4-0.5 |
| Medieval England | 0.4-0.5 |
| Pre-industrial Europe | 0.5-0.6 |

*Historical estimates very uncertain.*

### The Extraction Ratio

| Concept | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| Maximum inequality | If elites took everything above subsistence |
| Actual inequality | What they actually took |
| Extraction ratio | Actual / Maximum |

Most pre-industrial societies extracted 50-80% of the possible surplus.

## Comparative Perspectives

### Richest of Each Era?

| Claim | Candidate | Problem |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| Richest ever | Mansa Musa | State vs. personal wealth |
| Richest Roman | Augustus or Crassus | Emperor = state? |
| Richest medieval | Fugger? Medici? | Comparison difficult |
| Richest industrial | Rockefeller | Best documented |

### Wealth Relative to Economy

| Individual | % of GDP (very rough) |
|------------|----------------------|
| Crassus | ~2% of Roman GDP? |
| Fugger | ~1% of HRE GDP? |
| Rockefeller (1913) | ~2% of US GDP |

These comparisons suggest similar relative scale across eras.
