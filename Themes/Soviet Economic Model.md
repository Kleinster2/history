# Soviet Economic Model

The command economy alternative. For seventy years, the Soviet Union tested whether economic coordination could work without markets—whether central planning could allocate resources, direct investment, and generate growth. The experiment achieved rapid industrialization but ultimately failed, providing evidence about the limits of non-market coordination.

## Core Features

### Theoretical Foundation

| Principle | Implementation |
|-----------|----------------|
| State ownership | All means of production |
| Central planning | Gosplan directs economy |
| No markets | Administrative allocation |
| No private profit | "From each according to ability" |

### Planning Mechanism

| Institution | Function |
|-------------|----------|
| Gosplan | Central planning agency |
| Five-Year Plans | Production targets |
| Material balances | Input-output accounting |
| Ministries | Sectoral management |
| Enterprises | Production units |

## The Planning Problem

### What Planners Had to Decide

| Decision | Scale |
|----------|-------|
| What to produce | Millions of products |
| How much | Quantities of each |
| Where | Which factories |
| With what | Input allocation |
| For whom | Distribution |

### The Knowledge Problem

| Issue | Consequence |
|-------|-------------|
| Information dispersed | Planners can't know everything |
| Prices absent | No scarcity signals |
| Innovation unknown | Can't plan discoveries |
| Preferences hidden | What do consumers want? |

This was [[Austrian Economics|Hayek's critique]]: the knowledge needed for economic coordination exists only in dispersed form, transmitted through prices in market systems.

## Achievements

### Rapid Industrialization

| Period | Achievement |
|--------|-------------|
| 1928-1940 | Heavy industry built |
| Growth rates | High (official: 10%+, revised: 5-6%) |
| Structural change | Agricultural → industrial |
| Urbanization | Rural to urban migration |

### What Worked

| Success | Explanation |
|---------|-------------|
| Mobilization | State can direct resources |
| Heavy industry | Priority sectors get resources |
| Education | Massive literacy expansion |
| Military | WWII victory, space program |

### WWII

| Achievement | Significance |
|-------------|--------------|
| Survival | Against Nazi invasion |
| Production | Tanks, planes, weapons |
| Relocation | Industry moved east |
| Victory | Proved system could mobilize |

## Failures

### Agriculture

| Problem | Consequence |
|---------|-------------|
| Collectivization | Famine (1932-33), millions dead |
| Incentives | Peasants didn't invest |
| Productivity | Chronically low |
| Imports | USSR imported grain |

### Consumer Goods

| Problem | Consequence |
|---------|-------------|
| Low priority | Heavy industry favored |
| Shortages | Queuing, rationing |
| Quality | Poor, no competitive pressure |
| Variety | Limited choice |

### Innovation

| Problem | Consequence |
|---------|-------------|
| No incentive | Managers avoid risk |
| Information | Don't know what consumers want |
| Diffusion | New methods spread slowly |
| Copying | Could imitate, not innovate |

### The Stagnation

| Period | Character |
|--------|-----------|
| 1970s-80s | Growth slowed dramatically |
| Productivity | Declined |
| Technology gap | Widened vs. West |
| Living standards | Fell behind |

## Why It Failed

### Information Problem

| Issue | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| No prices | Can't calculate costs |
| No profit | Can't know what's valuable |
| Complexity | Millions of products |
| Coordination | Administratively impossible |

### Incentive Problem

| Issue | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| No ownership | No stake in efficiency |
| Soft budget constraint | Losses covered |
| Plan fulfillment | Meet target, ignore quality |
| Corruption | Use position for gain |

### Political Economy

| Issue | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| No exit | Can't leave bad jobs |
| No voice | Can't criticize system |
| Privilege | Elite captured benefits |
| Repression | Dissent punished |

## Comparative Performance

| Measure | Soviet | Capitalist |
|---------|--------|------------|
| Early growth | High | Variable |
| Late growth | Stagnant | Continued |
| Innovation | Copying | Creating |
| Consumer welfare | Poor | Higher |
| Environment | Devastating | Bad but less |

### The Convergence That Wasn't

| Prediction | Reality |
|------------|---------|
| Would catch up | Fell further behind |
| Would surpass | Never happened |
| Would prove superior | Collapsed |

## Legacy

### Post-Soviet

| Outcome | Character |
|---------|-----------|
| Transition | [[Post-Communist Transition]] |
| Variation | Poland success, Russia struggle |
| Institutions | Hard to build from scratch |

### Lessons Learned

| Lesson | Evidence |
|--------|----------|
| Markets work | Coordination through prices |
| Property matters | Ownership creates incentives |
| Information | Dispersed, can't be centralized |
| State role | Necessary but limited |

## The Deeper Point

The Soviet experiment tested whether [[Institutions and Progress|institutions]] could channel ambition into production without markets. The answer was: partially, temporarily, but not sustainably.

Central planning could mobilize resources for visible, measurable goals—industrialization, military production, space program. When planners knew what to produce and could direct resources there, the system worked. Heavy industry grew. The Nazis were defeated. Sputnik launched.

But the system couldn't solve the knowledge problem. Economic life involves billions of decisions about what to produce, how to produce it, and who should get it. Market prices aggregate dispersed knowledge into signals that guide these decisions. Without prices, planners had to guess—and systematically guessed wrong about consumer goods, quality, innovation, and efficiency.

The Soviet model also couldn't solve the incentive problem. When managers don't bear costs of failure or reap rewards of success, they have little reason to innovate, improve, or take risks. The system selected for political loyalty and plan fulfillment, not entrepreneurial drive.

The [[Institutions and Progress|institutional]] lesson is that ambition can be channeled by command for limited purposes, but sustained development requires the distributed coordination that markets provide. The Soviet experiment proved that the price system isn't just one way to organize an economy—it's the only way that scales to modern complexity.
