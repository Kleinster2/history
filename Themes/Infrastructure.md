# Infrastructure

Infrastructure—roads, bridges, canals, ports, aqueducts—enables economic activity by reducing transaction costs and connecting markets. From Roman roads to modern highways, infrastructure investment has shaped which regions prosper. Building and maintaining infrastructure requires resources and organization, making it a key indicator of state capacity. Infrastructure history reveals how societies invested in their economic futures.
