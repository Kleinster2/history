# Child Labor and Skill Formation

How societies form skills reveals institutional priorities. Apprenticeship invested in human capital through years of training; industrial child labor exploited small fingers and cheap wages; compulsory education represented state investment in future productivity. The transition from child labor to schooling was not inevitable—it required institutional change, political struggle, and economic development sufficient that children's earnings weren't essential. Investment in [[Human Capital|human capital]] compounds across generations; societies that made it flourished.

## Overview

| Era | Pattern |
|-----|---------|
| Pre-industrial | Apprenticeship + family labor |
| Industrial | Factory child labor |
| Reform era | Regulation, age limits |
| Modern | Compulsory education |
| Developing world | Transition ongoing |

## Apprenticeship as Education

### The System

| Feature | Character |
|---------|-----------|
| Duration | 5-7 years typically |

### Developing World

| Challenge | Reality |
|-----------|---------|
| Child labor persists | ~160 million globally |
| Agriculture | Majority of child labor |
| Poverty | Main driver |

### Transition Conditions

| What enabled reform | Explanation |
|---------------------|-------------|
| Rising incomes | Child earnings less necessary |
| Technology | Less need for small fingers |
| Political will | Reform coalitions |
| State capacity | Enforcement possible |
| Economic returns | Education paid off |

## The Deeper Point

How societies form skills reveals what [[Institutions and Progress|institutions]] prioritize. [[Guild Economics|Apprenticeship]] was a form of education—long investment in human capital that created skilled craftsmen. Industrial child labor was extraction—taking children's labor without investment in their development. Compulsory education was collective investment—society bearing the cost of forming future productivity. The transition wasn't automatic: it required that economic development reduce the necessity of child earnings, that reformers organize politically, that states build enforcement capacity, and that education's returns be recognized. Where the transition happened early—Prussia, Britain, the US—[[Human Capital|human capital]] compounded across generations. Where it was delayed—colonial extraction economies, later developers—the deficit persisted. The pattern reveals that [[Development Economics|development]] is not just about physical capital or institutions narrowly defined—it's about whether societies invest in their children. Apprenticeship channeled ambition into skill; factory labor exploited it; education developed it. The institutional choice determined whether children became assets to develop or resources to extract.
