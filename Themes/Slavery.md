# Slavery

Slavery—the ownership of humans as property—has existed in most complex societies throughout history. From ancient Mesopotamia to 19th-century America, enslaved people built pyramids, worked mines, cultivated plantations, and served in households. Slavery was not a marginal phenomenon but central to many economies. The Atlantic slave trade alone forcibly transported 12 million Africans. Understanding slavery means confronting how coerced labor shaped economic history.
