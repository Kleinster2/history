# Currency Interventions

Coordinated and unilateral attempts by governments and central banks to influence exchange rates. From the post-[[Bretton Woods]] era of floating rates through today, currency interventions reveal the tension between market forces and state desire for monetary control.

## 1. Plaza Accord (1985)

**The most successful coordinated intervention in history.**

### Context

| Problem | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| Dollar surge | +50% since 1980 |
| US trade deficit | Record levels |
| Reagan deficits | Fiscal expansion |
| Volcker rates | High interest rates attracted capital |
| Protectionist pressure | Congress threatening tariffs |

### The Deal (September 22, 1985)

| Country | Commitment |
|---------|------------|
| United States | Reduce budget deficit |
| Japan | Fiscal stimulus, open markets |
| Germany | Tax cuts |
| France | Fiscal restraint |
| UK | Monetary support |

**Mechanism:** Coordinated dollar selling by central banks + policy commitments.

### Results

| Metric | Change |
|--------|--------|
| USD/DEM | 2.84 → 1.63 (-43%) by 1987 |
| USD/JPY | 242 → 128 (-47%) by 1988 |
| US trade deficit | Slow improvement |
| Japan | Bubble economy began |

### Why It Worked

| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Dollar clearly overvalued | Market agreed with direction |
| Credible commitment | Major economies coordinated |
| Policy follow-through | Not just intervention |
| Market psychology | Signaled regime change |

---

## 2. Louvre Accord (1987)

**Attempt to stop Plaza's success.**

### Problem

| Issue | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| Dollar falling too fast | Overshooting |
| German/Japanese complaints | Currencies too strong |
| US inflation concerns | Weak dollar = imported inflation |

### The Deal (February 1987)

| Element | Commitment |
|---------|------------|
| Target ranges | Unofficial bands around current levels |
| Intervention | Coordinated buying to support dollar |
| Policy | Germany/Japan to stimulate demand |

### Results

| Outcome | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| Partial success | Dollar stabilized temporarily |
| Black Monday | October 1987 crash complicated picture |
| Coordination frayed | Policy commitments not fully kept |
| Lesson | Harder to stop than start depreciation |

---

## 3. ERM Crisis (1992)

**When markets broke the Bank of England.**

### Context

| Factor | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| European Exchange Rate Mechanism | Fixed bands before euro |
| German reunification | Bundesbank raised rates |
| UK recession | Needed lower rates |
| Contradiction | UK rates up to defend peg while economy weak |

### Black Wednesday (September 16, 1992)

| Time | Event |
|------|-------|
| Morning | Bank of England buying pounds |
| 11am | Rate hike announced (10% → 12%) |
| 2pm | Second hike announced (12% → 15%) |
| 7pm | UK withdraws from ERM |

### The Numbers

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| BOE reserves spent | £3.3 billion |
| Soros profit | ~$1 billion |
| UK cost | £3.4 billion |
| Rate hikes | Reversed same day |

### Lesson

**Unilateral defense against determined speculators fails when fundamentals misaligned.** The UK needed lower rates; defending an overvalued peg was economically irrational.

## 4. Asian Financial Crisis (1997-98)

**When pegs broke across a region.**

### The Dominoes

| Country | Peg | Collapse Date | Depreciation |
|---------|-----|---------------|--------------|
| Thailand | Baht/USD | July 1997 | -50% |
| Malaysia | Ringgit/USD | July 1997 | -45% |
| Indonesia | Rupiah/USD | August 1997 | -80% |
| South Korea | Won/USD | November 1997 | -50% |
| Philippines | Peso/USD | July 1997 | -40% |

### Intervention Attempts

| Country | Defense | Result |
|---------|---------|--------|
| Thailand | Spent $30B reserves | Failed, IMF bailout |
| Malaysia | Capital controls | Controversial success |
| Indonesia | IMF conditions | Political collapse |
| Hong Kong | Massive intervention | Defended peg |

### Why Hong Kong Survived

| Factor | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Currency board | Automatic, credible |
| Reserves | Huge ($96B) |
| Stock market intervention | Bought stocks directly |
| Political will | No devaluation option |

## 5. Japan's Mega-Intervention (2003-04)

**Largest intervention in history.**

### Scale

| Period | Amount | Direction |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| Jan 2003 - Mar 2004 | ¥35 trillion (~$320B) | Selling yen |

### Context

| Problem | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| Deflation | Japan stuck in deflation |
| Yen strength | Hurting exporters |
| Zero rates | Couldn't cut further |
| Quantitative easing | Already underway |

### Mechanism

| Step | Process |
|------|---------|
| MOF issues bonds | Finance intervention |
| BOJ buys dollars | Sell yen |
| Invest in Treasuries | Park proceeds |
| Result | Japan largest holder of US Treasuries |

### Effectiveness

| View | Assessment |
|------|------------|
| Short-term | Slowed yen appreciation |
| Long-term | Debatable impact on trend |
| Cost | Opportunity cost of reserves |
| Side effect | Funded US deficits |

## 6. Swiss Franc Floor (2011-2015)

**A central bank's line in the sand.**

### The Cap (September 6, 2011)

| Element | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| Floor | €1.00 = CHF 1.20 |
| Commitment | "Unlimited" intervention |
| Rationale | Franc too strong, deflation risk |
| Credibility | SNB balance sheet exploded |

### SNB Balance Sheet

| Date | Size (% GDP) |
|------|--------------|
| 2007 | ~20% |
| 2011 | ~50% |
| 2014 | ~85% |
| 2015 (pre-removal) | ~90% |

### The Unpeg (January 15, 2015)

| Time | Event |
|------|-------|
| 9:30am | SNB announces floor removed |
| Minutes later | CHF +20% vs EUR |
| Peak | CHF +41% intraday |
| Casualties | Brokers, hedge funds, carry traders |

### Why SNB Abandoned

| Factor | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| ECB QE coming | Would require even more intervention |
| Balance sheet risk | Enormous FX exposure |
| Credibility cost | Promised "unlimited" |
| Exit impossible | The longer, the harder |

### Lesson

**Even credible commitments have limits.** The SNB proved it would intervene massively—until it couldn't anymore.

## 7. Modern Era (2022-Present)

### Japan Yen Defense (2022)

| Date | Action | Amount |
|------|--------|--------|
| September 2022 | First intervention since 1998 | ¥2.8T |
| October 2022 | Additional intervention | ¥6.3T |
| Direction | Buying yen, selling dollars |
| Result | Temporary slowdown of depreciation |

### Context

| Factor | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| BOJ yield curve control | Kept rates near zero |
| Fed hiking | Dollar strengthening |
| Yen at 32-year low | 150 USD/JPY |
| Trade-off | Can't have low rates AND strong yen |

---

## Intervention Effectiveness

### When Interventions Work

| Condition | Why |
|-----------|-----|
| Aligned with fundamentals | Market agrees with direction |
| Coordinated | Multiple central banks |
| Large scale | Shows commitment |
| Policy support | Not just intervention |
| Element of surprise | Market positioning wrong |

### When They Fail

| Condition | Why |
|-----------|-----|
| Against fundamentals | Fighting the tide |
| Unilateral | Limited firepower |
| Defending overvalued peg | Speculators smell blood |
| No policy change | Intervention alone insufficient |
| Telegraphed | Market front-runs |

### The Asymmetry

| Direction | Difficulty |
|-----------|------------|
| Weakening own currency | Easy (print unlimited) |
| Strengthening own currency | Hard (limited reserves) |

A central bank can always weaken its currency—just create more of it. Defending requires spending finite reserves against potentially unlimited speculators.

## The Deeper Point

Currency interventions reveal the limits of state monetary control in a world of mobile capital. The [[Bretton Woods]] system maintained fixed rates through capital controls. Once capital flowed freely, the "impossible trinity" asserted itself: countries cannot simultaneously have fixed exchange rates, free capital movement, and independent monetary policy.

Successful interventions (Plaza) work with market forces and coordinate policy changes. Failed interventions (ERM, Asian crisis) try to defend indefensible positions. The Swiss franc saga shows even credible, well-resourced central banks eventually surrender to market reality.

The modern consensus: intervention can smooth volatility and correct overshooting but cannot sustain misaligned exchange rates indefinitely. [[Central Banking|Central banks]] learned that the credibility built through years of commitment can vanish in minutes (SNB) or survive through iron discipline (Hong Kong).
