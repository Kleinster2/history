## The Big Picture

### Money and Exchange

- [[Money]] - From cowrie shells to fiat currency
  - Commodity money, coinage, paper money
  - How money enabled specialization and trade
  - Why the Inca didn't need it (and what that tells us)

- [[Trade Networks]] - The arteries of economic progress
  - Bronze Age networks, Silk Road, Indian Ocean
  - How trade moved goods, ideas, technology, and disease
  - From land routes to sea routes

### Wealth and Development

- [[Wealth Through History]] - Who was rich and how
  - Ancient wealth (land, slaves, tribute)
  - Medieval wealth (land, church, commerce)
  - Modern wealth (capital, industry, finance)
  - The persistence of wealth across centuries

- [[Great Divergence]] - Why Europe?
  - The question that dominates economic history
  - Institutions, geography, colonies, contingency
  - From rough parity to Western dominance

### Patterns and Continuity

- [[Economic Convergence]] - Why the world looks similar
  - Markets won (eventually)
  - Technology spreads
  - Institutions converge
  - Exceptions prove rules

- [[Economic Persistence]] - What survives
  - Property rights
  - Money and exchange
  - Specialization
  - Human response to incentives

- [[Economic Collapse]] - How systems fail
  - Bronze Age collapse, Rome, Song China
  - Complexity, fragility, interdependence
  - What collapses teach us about stability

## The Throughline

All these notes serve a single inquiry: **How did humanity go from universal poverty to unprecedented wealth?**

The journey involved:
1. **Origins** - Investment thinking, delayed returns
2. **Agriculture** - Surplus, storage, specialization
3. **Cities** - Division of labor, markets
4. **Money** - Universal exchange medium
5. **Trade** - Connecting distant economies
6. **Finance** - Capital accumulation
7. **Industry** - Energy, machines, growth
8. **Divergence** - Why some got rich first
9. **Convergence** - Why others are catching up
