## The Throughline

All these notes serve a single inquiry: **How did humanity go from universal poverty to unprecedented wealth?**

The answer, traced through every period: [[Institutions and Progress|institutions that channel human ambition into production rather than extraction]]. The journey involved:

1. **Origins** - Investment thinking, delayed returns
2. **Agriculture** - Surplus, storage, specialization
3. **Cities** - Division of labor, markets
4. **Money** - Universal exchange medium
5. **Trade** - Connecting distant economies
6. **Finance** - Capital accumulation
7. **Industry** - Energy, machines, growth
8. **Divergence** - Why some got rich first
9. **Convergence** - Why others are catching up

At every stage, the question is the same: what made the ambitious person build rather than take?
