# Import Substitution Industrialization

The development strategy that dominated mid-20th century. ISI—protecting domestic industries to replace imports with local production—was the default approach from the 1950s through 1980s in Latin America, South Asia, and Africa. It achieved initial successes but ultimately failed to generate sustained growth, yielding to market-oriented reforms.

## The Theory

### Core Idea

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Problem | Developing countries export raw materials, import manufactures |
| Diagnosis | Terms of trade decline for primary products |
| Solution | Industrialize domestically |
| Method | Protect infant industries |

### Intellectual Foundations

| Source | Contribution |
|--------|--------------|
| Prebisch-Singer thesis | Terms of trade deteriorate for commodities |
| Infant industry argument | Protection until competitive |
| Dependency theory | Core exploits periphery |
| Structuralism | Markets fail in developing countries |

### Policy Tools

| Tool | Function |
|------|----------|
| Tariffs | Make imports expensive |
| Quotas | Limit import quantities |
| Exchange controls | Allocate foreign currency |
| State enterprises | Direct production |
| Licensing | Control entry |

## Implementation

### Where and When

| Region | Period | Character |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| Latin America | 1950s-1980s | Most comprehensive |
| India | 1950s-1991 | "License Raj" |
| Sub-Saharan Africa | 1960s-1980s | Post-independence |
| Middle East | 1950s-1980s | State-led |

### Stages

| Stage | Target |
|-------|--------|
| Easy ISI | Consumer goods (textiles, food) |
| Intermediate | Chemicals, steel, machinery |
| Advanced | Capital goods, technology |

Most countries struggled to move beyond easy ISI.

## Initial Successes

### What Worked Early

| Achievement | Evidence |
|-------------|----------|
| Industrial growth | Manufacturing sectors grew |
| Employment | Factory jobs created |
| Urbanization | Industrial cities emerged |
| Some learning | Technical capabilities developed |

### Latin American Examples

| Country | Period | Growth |
|---------|--------|--------|
| Brazil | 1950-1980 | 7% annual |
| Mexico | 1940-1980 | 6% annual |
| Argentina | 1950-1975 | Variable |

## Why It Failed

### Efficiency Problems

| Problem | Mechanism |
|---------|-----------|
| No competition | Protected firms don't improve |
| High costs | Domestic prices exceed world prices |
| Poor quality | No competitive pressure |
| Scale | Domestic markets too small |

### Rent-Seeking

| Problem | Mechanism |
|---------|-----------|
| License capture | Firms seek protection, not efficiency |
| Corruption | Officials sell licenses |
| Political economy | Protected interests block reform |
| Misallocation | Resources to connected, not productive |

### Balance of Payments

| Problem | Mechanism |
|---------|-----------|
| Still need imports | Capital goods, intermediate inputs |
| Export neglect | Bias against exports |
| Foreign exchange | Chronic shortages |
| Debt | Borrow to cover deficits |

### The Debt Crisis

| Event | Consequence |
|-------|-------------|
| Oil shocks (1973, 1979) | Import costs rose |
| Borrowing | To maintain model |
| Interest rate rise (1980s) | Debt unsustainable |
| Crisis | Mexico 1982, others follow |
| End of ISI | Model discredited |

## The Contrast: Export-Oriented Industrialization

### East Asian Alternative

| Feature | ISI | EOI |
|---------|-----|-----|
| Trade stance | Inward | Outward |
| Competition | Protected | World markets |
| Incentives | Rent-seeking | Export performance |
| Learning | Limited | Forced by competition |

### Why East Asia Worked

| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Export discipline | Perform or lose support |
| Competition | World market forces efficiency |
| Scale | Global markets allow specialization |
| Learning | From demanding customers |

## The Intellectual Shift

### Washington Consensus

| Prescription | Rationale |
|--------------|-----------|
| Trade liberalization | Competition improves efficiency |
| Deregulation | Remove rent-seeking |
| Privatization | Market allocation |
| Fiscal discipline | End subsidies |

### Critique of Consensus

| Argument | Evidence |
|----------|----------|
| Too rapid | Shock without adjustment |
| Ignores institutions | Markets need supporting infrastructure |
| One-size-fits-all | Different contexts |
| East Asia | Had industrial policy, not pure markets |

## Legacy

### What ISI Built

| Legacy | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Industrial base | Some survived liberalization |
| Human capital | Skills persisted |
| Urban infrastructure | Cities exist |
| Learning | Some technological capability |

### What ISI Cost

| Cost | Evidence |
|------|----------|
| Decades of inefficiency | Protected sectors never competitive |
| Rent-seeking habits | Political economy persists |
| Export bias | Hard to reorient |
| Debt | Burdens continue |

## Modern Relevance

### Industrial Policy Revival

| Context | Example |
|---------|---------|
| China | Selective protection + export push |
| Vietnam | Similar hybrid |
| Africa | Some ISI elements returning |
| Global South | "Policy space" debates |

### Lessons Learned

| Lesson | Application |
|--------|-------------|
| Protection isn't enough | Must export eventually |
| Competition matters | Even in infant industry phase |
| Rent-seeking danger | Institutions to prevent |
| Context matters | No universal prescription |

## The Deeper Point

ISI's failure wasn't that protection is always wrong but that protection without discipline produces rent-seeking rather than learning. The [[Institutions and Progress|institutional]] design matters: East Asian states protected industries but demanded export performance. Latin American states protected industries and let them stagnate.

The deeper lesson is about [[Rent-Seeking Economics|rent-seeking]]. Protection creates rents—above-market returns to favored firms. Whether those rents get channeled into investment and improvement or captured as pure profit depends on institutional arrangements. ISI countries lacked the mechanisms to prevent capture.

The contrast with export orientation reveals the role of competition. World markets are demanding customers; domestic markets protected by tariffs are not. Learning happens when firms must meet global standards. ISI removed that discipline.

But the ISI experience also cautions against market fundamentalism. Simply removing protection doesn't create competitive industries. The adjustment costs are real, the institutional requirements substantial. The question isn't protection vs. free markets but what institutional arrangements channel protection toward development rather than rent extraction.
