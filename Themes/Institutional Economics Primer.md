# Institutional Economics Primer

Why are some countries rich and others poor? Why did the Industrial Revolution happen in Britain? Why do some societies develop while others stagnate? The dominant answer in contemporary economics is **institutions**—the rules, norms, and enforcement mechanisms that structure human interaction. This note introduces the key theorists and frameworks that underpin this view, which runs throughout this vault.

## Overview

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Core claim | Institutions determine economic outcomes |
| Definition | Rules of the game (formal and informal) |
| Key theorists | North, Acemoglu, Robinson, Olson, Ostrom |
| Implication | Geography, culture, resources matter less than rules |
| Policy | Get institutions right |

## What Are Institutions?

### Douglass North's Definition

| Type | Examples |
|------|----------|
| Formal | Constitutions, laws, property rights, contracts |
| Informal | Norms, customs, traditions, codes of conduct |
| Enforcement | Courts, police, social sanctions |

### Why They Matter

| Function | Effect |
|----------|--------|
| Reduce uncertainty | Know what to expect |
| Define incentives | Shape behavior |
| Structure exchange | Enable cooperation |
| Lower transaction costs | Make markets possible |

## The Key Theorists

### Douglass North (1920-2015)

| Contribution | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| Core work | *Institutions, Institutional Change and Economic Performance* (1990) |
| Key insight | Institutions determine transaction costs |
| Nobel Prize | 1993 (with Robert Fogel) |
| Link | [[Douglass North]] |

**The argument:** Economic performance depends on the costs of transacting. Institutions that lower transaction costs (secure property, enforceable contracts, reliable information) enable markets and specialization. Institutions that raise transaction costs (insecure property, arbitrary enforcement, corruption) prevent development.

### Daron Acemoglu & James Robinson

| Contribution | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| Core work | *Why Nations Fail* (2012) |
| Key insight | Inclusive vs. extractive institutions |
| Empirical | Colonial origins natural experiments |
| Link | [[Why Nations Fail]] |

**The argument:** Societies with **inclusive institutions** (broad participation, secure property, rule of law) develop. Societies with **extractive institutions** (narrow elite, insecure property, arbitrary rule) stagnate. Political institutions determine economic institutions—you can't have economic inclusion without political inclusion.

### Mancur Olson (1932-1998)

| Contribution | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| Core works | *The Logic of Collective Action* (1965), *Rise and Decline of Nations* (1982) |
| Key insight | Collective action problems; distributional coalitions |
| Link | [[Mancur Olson]] |

**The argument:** Groups don't automatically act in their collective interest—small groups with concentrated benefits organize, while large groups with diffuse benefits don't. Over time, stable societies accumulate "distributional coalitions" (lobbies, cartels, unions) that seek rents rather than growth. This explains why long-stable societies often stagnate while post-war/post-revolution societies grow fast.

### North, Wallis & Weingast

| Contribution | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| Core work | *Violence and Social Orders* (2009) |
| Key insight | Limited vs. open access orders |
| Link | [[Violence and Social Orders]] |

**The argument:** Most societies throughout history are **limited access orders**—elites maintain stability by dividing rents among themselves. Violence is contained by giving violent actors a stake. Only recently have some societies become **open access orders**—where entry is free, competition is open, and organizations can form without elite permission. The transition is rare and fragile.

### Elinor Ostrom (1933-2012)

| Contribution | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| Core work | *Governing the Commons* (1990) |
| Key insight | Commons can be self-governed |
| Nobel Prize | 2009 |
| Correction | Hardin's "tragedy" isn't inevitable |

**The argument:** Communities can develop institutions to manage common resources without privatization or state control. Through case studies of fisheries, forests, and irrigation, Ostrom showed that local institutional design—clear boundaries, collective choice, monitoring, graduated sanctions—can solve collective action problems.

## Key Concepts

### Transaction Costs (North)

| Type | Examples |
|------|----------|
| Search costs | Finding trading partners |
| Bargaining costs | Negotiating terms |
| Enforcement costs | Ensuring compliance |
| Measurement costs | Verifying quality |

Institutions that reduce these costs enable more trade, specialization, and growth.

### Inclusive vs. Extractive (Acemoglu & Robinson)

| Dimension | Inclusive | Extractive |
|-----------|-----------|------------|
| Political | Pluralistic, distributed power | Concentrated, absolutist |
| Economic | Secure property, open entry | Insecure property, barriers |
| Example | Post-1688 England | Colonial Congo |
| Outcome | Growth | Stagnation |

### Collective Action Problems (Olson)

| Problem | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Free rider | Why contribute if you get benefits anyway? |
| Concentrated vs. diffuse | Small groups with big stakes organize |
| Distributional coalitions | Rent-seekers accumulate over time |
| Sclerosis | Old societies clogged with lobbies |

### Limited vs. Open Access (NWW)

| Feature | Limited Access | Open Access |
|---------|----------------|-------------|
| Entry | Restricted | Free |
| Organizations | Elite permission needed | Anyone can form |
| Violence | Contained by rent-sharing | State monopoly |
| Impersonal exchange | Limited | Extensive |
| Examples | Most of history | Modern democracies |

## The Evidence

### Colonial Origins

| Study | Finding |
|-------|---------|
| Acemoglu, Johnson, Robinson (2001) | Where Europeans settled, they built inclusive institutions; where they extracted, extractive institutions persisted |
| Reversal of fortune | Formerly rich colonies (Aztec, Inca) are now poor; formerly poor (US, Australia) are now rich |
| Instrument | Settler mortality predicts current institutions |

### Natural Experiments

| Case | Comparison |
|------|------------|
| North vs. South Korea | Same culture, different institutions, vast outcome gap |
| East vs. West Germany | Same, then diverged, then converged after reunification |
| Nogales, Arizona vs. Nogales, Sonora | Same city, border divides institutions and outcomes |

### Historical Persistence

| Finding | Source |
|---------|--------|
| Colonial institutions persist | Acemoglu & Robinson |
| Medieval city freedoms predict current prosperity | DeLong & Shleifer |
| Trust levels persist for centuries | Nunn & Wantchekon |

## The Debates

### Geography vs. Institutions

| Geography (Sachs) | Institutions (Acemoglu) |
|-------------------|-------------------------|
| Tropics are poor because of disease, climate | Tropics are poor because of extractive colonial institutions |
| Landlocked countries disadvantaged | Landlocked can develop with good institutions |
| Resources matter | Resources can be curse without institutions |

### Culture vs. Institutions

| Culture (Weber, Landes) | Institutions |
|-------------------------|--------------|
| Protestant ethic drove capitalism | Institutions created Protestant ethic's effects |
| Chinese culture prevented development | China with different institutions (Taiwan, Singapore) developed |
| Hard to change culture | Institutions can be designed |

### Chicken and Egg

| Question | Difficulty |
|----------|------------|
| Do institutions cause growth? | Or does growth enable good institutions? |
| Endogeneity problem | Rich countries can afford rule of law |
| Colonial instruments | Attempt to establish causation |
| Consensus | Institutions matter, but causation is complex |

## Policy Implications

### What "Get Institutions Right" Means

| Priority | Mechanism |
|----------|-----------|
| Secure property rights | Investment incentive |
| Rule of law | Contract enforcement |
| Constraint on elites | Prevent extraction |
| Open entry | Competition, innovation |
| Accountability | Align incentives |

### Why It's Hard

| Challenge | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Elites resist | Good institutions threaten their rents |
| Path dependence | Extractive institutions are sticky |
| No blueprint | What works is context-dependent |
| Washington Consensus failures | Imposing institutions doesn't always work |
| Time | Institutional change is slow |

### The Transition Problem

| Issue | Implication |
|-------|-------------|
| NWW's puzzle | Transition from limited to open access is rare |
| Requires | Elite beliefs must change |
| Not just laws | Informal norms matter too |
| China puzzle | Economic growth without political opening—how long? |

## How This Vault Uses Institutional Theory

Every note in this vault implicitly asks: **What were the institutions, and how did they channel human behavior?**

| Note | Institutional Question |
|------|------------------------|
| [[Great Divergence]] | Why did Europe's institutions enable breakthrough? |
| [[Industrial Revolution]] | What institutional mix enabled factory capitalism? |
| [[Economic Collapse]] | What institutional failures cause collapse? |
| [[Argentina Economic History]] | Why couldn't Argentina build stable institutions? |
| [[Australia Economic History]] | Why did similar resources + different institutions = different outcomes? |
| [[Resource Curse]] | Why do resources undermine institutions? |

The [[Institutions and Progress]] note applies this framework throughout human history. This primer provides the theoretical foundation.
