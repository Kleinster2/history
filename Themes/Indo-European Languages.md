# Indo-European Languages

The Indo-European language family—spanning from Ireland to India—is history's most widespread linguistic group, spoken by nearly half of humanity. The spread of Indo-European languages from the Pontic steppe around 3000 BCE represents one of prehistory's most significant migrations. [[Ancient DNA]] now confirms what linguists long suspected: languages spread with people. Understanding Indo-European dispersal illuminates how cultural and genetic change interconnect.
