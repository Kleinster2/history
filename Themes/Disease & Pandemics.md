# Disease & Pandemics

Disease has shaped history as decisively as any war or revolution. The Antonine Plague weakened Rome, the Black Death transformed medieval Europe, and smallpox conquered the Americas for Spain. Epidemics kill millions, collapse economies, and reshape societies. Understanding disease history reveals the vulnerability of all civilizations and the intimate connection between biology and economy.
