# Inequality

Inequality is not natural—it has a history. For most of human existence, there was little to be unequal about. Then agriculture created surplus, and surplus created hierarchy. Inequality rose with civilization, fell with catastrophe, and exploded again with industrialization. The 20th century reversed millennia of concentration; the 21st may be reversing the reversal.

## Overview

### The Arc of Inequality

| Era | Pattern |
|-----|---------|
| Hunter-gatherer | Minimal inequality |
| Agricultural | Rising inequality |
| Agrarian empires | High inequality |
| Industrial | Rising, then falling |
| Post-1980 | Rising again |

### Why It Matters

| Dimension | Significance |
|-----------|--------------|
| Economic | Affects growth, stability |
| Political | Shapes power |
| Social | Affects cohesion |
| Moral | Justice questions |

## Prehistoric Equality

### Why Foragers Were Equal

| Factor | Mechanism |
|--------|-----------|
| No surplus | Nothing to hoard |
| Mobility | Can't accumulate |
| Sharing norms | Social insurance |
| Exit | Leave bad groups |

### The Numbers

| Measure | Hunter-gatherers |
|---------|-----------------|
| Gini coefficient | 0.25-0.30 |
| Wealth holdings | Minimal |
| Status | Age, skill |

## Agricultural Inequality

### How Surplus Created Hierarchy

| Development | Effect |
|-------------|--------|
| Settled farming | Surplus possible |
| Storage | Wealth accumulation |
| Land ownership | Unequal |
| Inheritance | Concentration |

### Early Stratification

| Society | Pattern |
|---------|---------|
| Mesopotamia | Temple, palace wealth |
| Egypt | Pharaonic concentration |
| China | Aristocratic land |
| Rome | Senatorial latifundia |

## Pre-Industrial Patterns

### Agrarian Inequality

| Measure | Typical Gini |
|---------|--------------|
| Land | 0.70-0.80 |
| Income | 0.40-0.60 |
| Pre-industrial ceiling | ~0.60 (extraction limit) |

### What Limited Inequality

| Factor | Mechanism |
|--------|-----------|

### 19th Century Rise

| Country | Inequality Trend |
|---------|------------------|
| Britain | Rose 1780-1870 |
| United States | Rose 1820-1910 |
| General | Capital vs. labor |

### Why It Rose

| Factor | Mechanism |
|--------|-----------|
| Capital returns | High profits |
| Urbanization | Low wages |
| Skill premiums | Education gap |
| No redistribution | Minimal welfare |

---

## The Great Compression (1914-1980)

### What Happened

| Period | Inequality Trend |
|--------|------------------|
| 1914-1945 | Collapsed |
| 1945-1980 | Stayed low |

### Why Inequality Fell

| Factor | Mechanism |
|--------|-----------|
| World Wars | Capital destroyed |
| Progressive taxation | High marginal rates |
| Labor power | Unions strong |
| Welfare states | Redistribution |
| Education expansion | Skill supply rose |

### The Numbers

| Measure | 1910 | 1950 | 1980 |
|---------|------|------|------|
| Top 1% share (US) | 18% | 10% | 8% |
| Top 1% share (UK) | 22% | 12% | 6% |

### "The Great Compression" (Goldin & Margo)

| Period | Character |
|--------|-----------|
| 1940-1980 | Wages converged |
| Mechanism | Education, unions, policy |
| Result | Middle-class society |

---

## The Great Divergence (1980-Present)

### What Happened

| Period | Inequality Trend |
|--------|------------------|
| 1980-2020 | Rising sharply |
| Location | Especially US, UK |

### The Numbers

| Measure | 1980 | 2020 |
|---------|------|------|
| Top 1% share (US) | 8% | 20% |
| Gini (US) | 0.35 | 0.49 |
| CEO-worker ratio | 30:1 | 300:1 |

### Why Inequality Rose

| Factor | Mechanism |
|--------|-----------|
| Globalization | Low-skill competition |
| Technology | Skill-biased |
| Deunionization | Workers weakened |
| Tax cuts | Top rates fell |
| Financialization | Capital gains |
| Winner-take-all | Superstar economics |

## Global Inequality

### Between Countries

| Measure | Trend |
|---------|-------|
| 1820-1950 | Great Divergence (widening) |
| 1950-1980 | Stable |
| 1980-present | Converging (China, Asia) |

### Within Countries

### Wealth More Concentrated

| Measure | Wealth Gini | Income Gini |
|---------|-------------|-------------|

| r | Return on capital |
| g | Economic growth |
| If r > g | Wealth concentrates |
| Historical norm | r > g |
| 20th century | Exception (wars, taxes) |

| Charity | Insufficient scale |
| Market forces | Tend toward concentration |

---

## Debates

### Is Inequality Bad for Growth?

| View | Argument |
|------|----------|
| Yes | Demand, human capital, instability |
| No | Incentives, investment |
| Complicated | Depends on type, level |

### What Level Is Acceptable?

| View | Argument |
|------|----------|
| Rawlsian | Minimize disadvantage |
| Utilitarian | Maximize total welfare |
| Libertarian | Accept market outcomes |
| Historical | Depends on legitimacy |

## The Deeper Point

Scheidel's devastating finding: across all recorded history, only four forces have substantially reduced inequality—mass-mobilization warfare, revolution, state collapse, and plague. Peaceful redistribution through [[Institutions and Progress|institutional]] reform has never achieved leveling at the same scale. The postwar compression (1945-1975) was the product of all four (two world wars, communist threat, Depression trauma). Once those pressures faded, inequality returned to pre-war levels within a generation—Piketty's r > g operating without political constraint. This suggests that the institutional channels which reduce inequality ([[Taxation|progressive taxation]], [[Labor and Unions|unions]], [[Welfare State|welfare states]]) require existential political pressure to create and maintain. The [[Gilded Age]] compressed into the [[Postwar Boom]] only through catastrophic violence; the postwar equality decompressed into neoliberal inequality through nothing more than the fading of wartime memory. The question for the 21st century: can institutional design reduce inequality without catastrophe, or is Scheidel's pattern permanent? The answer matters because extreme inequality doesn't just offend justice—it undermines the broad-based demand and political stability that [[Innovation Economics|productive economies]] require.
