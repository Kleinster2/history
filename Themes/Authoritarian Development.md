# Authoritarian Development

Can dictatorships deliver growth? Some authoritarian regimes have achieved remarkable economic development—Singapore, South Korea under Park, China since Deng. But most dictatorships deliver stagnation or worse. Understanding why some authoritarian developers succeed while most fail illuminates the relationship between political institutions and economic performance.

## The Puzzle

### Successful Cases

| Country | Period | Growth |
|---------|--------|--------|
| Singapore | 1965-present | ~7% annual |
| South Korea | 1961-1987 | ~8% annual |
| Taiwan | 1949-1987 | ~8% annual |
| China | 1978-present | ~9% annual |
| Rwanda | 1994-present | ~7% annual |

### Failed Cases (Most Dictatorships)

| Country | Period | Outcome |
|---------|--------|---------|
| Zaire/DRC | 1965-1997 | Kleptocracy, collapse |
| Philippines | 1965-1986 | Marcos extraction |
| Most African | Post-independence | Stagnation |
| North Korea | 1948-present | Economic disaster |
| Venezuela | 1999-present | Collapse |

## Why Most Dictatorships Fail

### Incentive Problems

| Issue | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| No accountability | No electoral punishment |
| Short horizons | Extract now, leave later |
| Selectorate theory | Reward small coalition |
| No voice | Citizens can't signal |

### Institutional Problems

| Issue | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| Weak property rights | Ruler can expropriate |
| No constraints | No checks on bad policy |
| Succession uncertainty | Investment deterred |
| Information deficit | No free press, bad data |

### Typical Pattern

| Phase | Character |
|-------|-----------|
| Early | Consolidate power |
| Middle | Extract rents |
| Late | Crisis, collapse, or transition |

## What Makes Developmental Autocrats Different?

### Long Time Horizons

| Factor | Mechanism |
|--------|-----------|
| Secure tenure | Not threatened by coup |
| Succession plan | Future beyond self |
| Reputation | Wants legacy |
| Ownership stake | Benefits from growth |

### Elite Coherence

| Factor | Mechanism |
|--------|-----------|
| Unified leadership | Can implement policy |
| Technocratic capacity | Competent bureaucracy |
| Limited patronage | Not captured by cronies |
| Performance legitimacy | Growth justifies rule |

### External Pressure

| Factor | Mechanism |
|--------|-----------|
| Security threats | Must develop to survive |
| Cold War context | Geopolitical competition |
| Aid conditionality | Some accountability |
| Example: Korea | North Korean threat |

## Case Studies

### Singapore

| Feature | Character |
|---------|-----------|
| Lee Kuan Yew | Long tenure (1959-1990) |
| PAP dominance | One-party state |
| Meritocracy | Technocratic government |
| No corruption | Severe penalties |
| Performance | Extraordinary growth |

### South Korea

| Feature | Character |
|---------|-----------|
| Park Chung-hee | 1961-1979 |
| Chaebol system | State-directed conglomerates |
| Export discipline | Perform or lose support |
| External threat | North Korea |
| Transition | Democratized 1987 |

### China

| Feature | Character |
|---------|-----------|
| Deng Xiaoping | 1978-1992 |
| CCP maintains power | One-party rule |
| Market reforms | Within political constraints |
| Performance legitimacy | Growth justifies party |
| Current | Xi Jinping, recentralization |

### Rwanda

| Feature | Character |
|---------|-----------|
| Kagame | 1994-present |
| Post-genocide | Reconstruction imperative |
| Technocratic | Focus on delivery |
| Criticism | Political repression |
| Question | Sustainable without Kagame? |

## The Selection Problem

### Why We See Some Success

| Issue | Implication |
|-------|-------------|
| Survivor bias | Failed states don't appear |
| Attribution | Would democracy have done better? |
| Counterfactual | What if Park hadn't been authoritarian? |
| Timing | Korea, Taiwan democratized after takeoff |

### The Numbers

| Finding | Evidence |
|---------|----------|
| Most dictatorships fail | ~70% have negative per capita growth |
| Variance | Higher than democracies |
| Extremes | Best and worst are authoritarian |
| Average | Democracies do better on average |

## Theoretical Frameworks

### Selectorate Theory (Bueno de Mesquita)

| Concept | Implication |
|---------|-------------|
| Winning coalition | Who keeps leader in power |
| Small coalition | Rewards, not public goods |
| Large coalition | Must provide public goods |
| Authoritarian | Small coalition, private goods |

### Developmental State Theory

| Concept | Implication |
|---------|-------------|
| Embedded autonomy | State connected but independent |
| Pilot agency | Coordinates development |
| Industrial policy | State guides market |
| Requires | Capable, uncorrupted bureaucracy |

### Olson's Stationary Bandit

| Concept | Implication |
|---------|-------------|
| Roving bandit | Extracts and leaves |
| Stationary bandit | Has stake in growth |
| Encompassing interest | Benefits from prosperity |
| Becomes | De facto property rights |

## Conditions for Success

### Necessary Conditions

| Factor | Why |
|--------|-----|
| Leadership quality | Benevolent dictator rare |
| Bureaucratic capacity | Must implement |
| Secure tenure | Long horizons |
| Growth orientation | Wants development |

### Helpful Conditions

| Factor | Why |
|--------|-----|
| External threat | Focus, discipline |
| Small country | Easier to coordinate |
| Homogeneous | Less patronage pressure |
| Late developer | Can copy |

### Missing in Most Cases

| What's Usually Missing | Consequence |
|------------------------|-------------|
| Benevolent intent | Extraction instead |
| Competent bureaucracy | Can't implement |
| Security | Short horizons |
| Growth orientation | Rent-seeking instead |

## The Democracy Question

### Arguments for Democracy

| Argument | Evidence |
|----------|----------|
| Information | Free press, better policy |
| Accountability | Electoral punishment |
| Rights | Intrinsic value |
| Long-run | Democratic institutions stable |

### Arguments for Autocracy (for Development)

| Argument | Evidence |
|----------|----------|
| Decisiveness | Can push through reform |
| Long horizons | Not electoral cycle |
| Insulation | From populist pressure |
| Evidence | Some successes |

### The Synthesis

| Finding | Implication |
|---------|-------------|
| Authoritarian development possible | But rare |
| Democracy not necessary | For initial takeoff |
| Democracy may help sustain | Long-run institutions |
| Transition timing | Matters |

## The Deeper Point

Authoritarian development is possible but rare because it requires an improbable combination: a leader who wants growth rather than extraction, has secure tenure for long horizons, commands a competent bureaucracy, and faces discipline from external threats or internal commitments.

The [[Institutions and Progress|institutional]] lesson is that what matters isn't the label—democracy vs. autocracy—but the incentive structure. When rulers have encompassing interests in growth, they pursue growth-promoting policies. When they can extract without consequence, they extract. Most dictatorships create incentives for extraction; a few create incentives for development.

The successful developmental autocrats also share a feature: they eventually transitioned or face pressure to transition. Korea and Taiwan democratized after achieving middle-income status. Singapore faces succession questions. China's model is tested by Xi's recentralization. The developmental autocracy may be a transitional phase, not an endpoint.

The policy implication is sobering. You cannot reliably create developmental autocracies—the conditions are too specific, the leaders too rare. The argument that "what Africa needs is a Lee Kuan Yew" ignores that Lee Kuan Yews are historically exceptional. The safer bet is institutional development that doesn't depend on finding benevolent dictators.
