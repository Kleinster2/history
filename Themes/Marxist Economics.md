# Marxist Economics

The critique tradition analyzing exploitation and accumulation. Marxist economics asks who captures the gains from progress—the same question the vault asks, with different answers.

## Origins

### Marx's Project

| Work | Focus |
|------|-------|
| *Communist Manifesto* (1848) | Political program |
| *Grundrisse* (1857-58) | Notebooks, drafts |
| *Capital* Volume I (1867) | Critique of political economy |
| Volumes II & III (posthumous) | Circulation, tendency of profit |

### Intellectual Context

| Influence | Incorporation |
|-----------|---------------|
| Classical economics | Labor theory of value (Ricardo) |
| Hegelian philosophy | Dialectical method |
| French socialism | Revolutionary politics |
| English conditions | Industrial capitalism observation |

## Core Concepts

### Labor Theory of Value

| Concept | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| Value | Socially necessary labor time |
| Use value | Usefulness of commodity |
| Exchange value | What it trades for |
| Abstract labor | Homogeneous labor in general |

### Surplus Value

| Element | Explanation |
|---------|-------------|
| Labor power | Worker sells capacity to work |
| Necessary labor | Time to reproduce labor power (wages) |
| Surplus labor | Time beyond necessary |
| Surplus value | Surplus labor appropriated by capitalist |
| Exploitation | Ratio of surplus to necessary labor |

### Capital and Accumulation

| Concept | Process |
|---------|---------|
| Constant capital (c) | Machinery, raw materials |
| Variable capital (v) | Wages (the only source of surplus) |
| M-C-M' | Money → Commodity → More money |
| Accumulation | Reinvesting surplus value |

## Primitive Accumulation

### The Original Sin of Capital

| Process | Mechanism |
|---------|-----------|
| Enclosure | Dispossessing peasants from land |
| Colonial extraction | Wealth transfer from colonies |
| Slave trade | [[Atlantic Slave Trade|Forced labor]] |
| State violence | Enforcing property, suppressing resistance |

### Contemporary Applications

| Arena | Interpretation |
|-------|----------------|
| Land grabs | Continuing dispossession |
| Privatization | Enclosing commons |
| Intellectual property | Enclosing knowledge |
| Financialization | Extracting from households |

## Crisis Theory

### Tendency of the Rate of Profit to Fall

| Mechanism | Explanation |
|-----------|-------------|
| Organic composition | c/v rises (more machines, fewer workers) |
| But only v creates surplus | Profit relative to total capital falls |
| Counter-tendencies | Increased exploitation, cheaper inputs |
| Outcome | Recurrent crises |

### Underconsumption/Overproduction

| Version | Mechanism |
|---------|-----------|
| Underconsumption | Workers can't buy what they produce |
| Overproduction | Too much capital chasing too few profits |
| Disproportionality | Sectors don't grow in sync |
| Realization crisis | Can't sell commodities at value |

### Cycles and Crises

| Pattern | Marxist Interpretation |
|---------|------------------------|
| Boom | Accumulation proceeds |
| Crisis | Contradictions erupt |
| Bust | Destroys capital, restores profitability |
| Recovery | Cycle repeats |

## Class Analysis

### The Two Great Classes

| Class | Relation to Means of Production |
|-------|--------------------------------|
| Bourgeoisie | Own means of production |
| Proletariat | Sell labor power |
| Petit bourgeoisie | Small owners, transitional |
| Lumpenproletariat | Outside production |

### Class Struggle

| Dimension | Manifestation |
|-----------|---------------|
| Economic | Wages, conditions |
| Political | State power |
| Ideological | Hegemony |
| Historical | Mode of production transitions |

## Historical Materialism

### Base and Superstructure

| Level | Contents |
|-------|----------|
| Base (economic) | Forces and relations of production |
| Superstructure | Law, politics, ideology, culture |
| Determination | Base shapes superstructure |
| Relative autonomy | Superstructure has some independence |

### Modes of Production

| Mode | Surplus Extraction |
|------|-------------------|
| Primitive communism | No surplus |
| Slavery | Direct ownership |
| Feudalism | Serfdom, tribute |
| Capitalism | Wage labor, surplus value |
| Socialism/Communism | Collective ownership |

## Influence and Applications

### Soviet Planning

| Adoption | Modification |
|----------|--------------|
| State ownership | Means of production |
| Central planning | Replacing markets |
| Industrialization | Primitive socialist accumulation |
| Outcome | [[Soviet Economic Model]] |

### Dependency Theory

| Application | Argument |
|-------------|----------|
| Core-periphery | Global exploitation |
| Unequal exchange | Value transfer to rich countries |
| Underdevelopment | Active process, not backwardness |
| Decolonization | Necessary but insufficient |

### Contemporary Marxism

| School | Focus |
|--------|-------|
| World-systems (Wallerstein) | Global capitalism as unit |
| Regulation School | Fordism, post-Fordism |
| Analytical Marxism | Game theory, rational choice |
| Ecological Marxism | Capitalism and environment |

## Piketty and Marx

### *Capital in the 21st Century*

| Piketty | Relationship to Marx |
|---------|---------------------|
| r > g | Returns exceed growth |
| Wealth concentration | Capital accumulates |
| Inheritance | Patrimonial capitalism |
| But: | No labor theory, no class struggle |

### Similarities and Differences

| Shared | Different |
|--------|-----------|
| Capital accumulates | Value theory |
| Inequality inherent | Revolution not solution |
| Historical data | Class analysis absent |
| Critique of capitalism | Reform, not overthrow |

## Critiques

### From Neoclassical Economics

| Critique | Challenge |
|----------|-----------|
| Labor theory of value | Marginal utility explains prices |
| Transformation problem | Can't derive prices from values |
| Exploitation concept | Voluntary exchange |
| Predictions failed | No immiseration, no revolution |

### From Austrian Economics

| Critique | Challenge |
|----------|-----------|
| Socialist calculation | Planning can't work |
| Knowledge problem | Dispersed information |
| Incentives | Bureaucrats don't innovate |
| Historical record | Soviet failure |

### Internal Debates

| Issue | Positions |
|-------|-----------|
| Transformation problem | Various solutions proposed |
| Falling rate of profit | Empirical evidence disputed |
| Revolution or reform | Lenin vs. Bernstein |
| Determinism | How much agency? |

## The Deeper Point

Marxist economics asks who captures the gains from progress—the same question the vault asks about [[Institutions and Progress|institutions channeling ambition]]. Marx's answer: capitalists extract surplus from workers through the wage relation. The institutional economics answer: it depends on how institutions are designed—some channel gains broadly, others concentrate them. Both traditions recognize that economic progress involves power, that distribution isn't automatic, and that institutions shape outcomes. Where they differ: Marx sees exploitation as inherent to capitalism (only abolition solves it), while institutional economics sees it as variable (better institutions can share gains more broadly). The Marxist tradition's lasting contribution is insisting that we ask the distributional question—not just how much progress, but *for whom*. The vault's emphasis on [[Colonial Extraction Mechanisms|extraction]] versus production echoes this concern, while reaching different conclusions about what enables broadly shared progress.
