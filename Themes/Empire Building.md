# Empire Building

Empires are large political units that rule diverse peoples through a combination of force, ideology, and administration. From Sargon of Akkad to the British Empire, the pattern recurs: conquest enables extraction, extraction funds further conquest, and administration sustains control. Understanding empires means understanding how power translates to economic benefit—and why empires eventually fall.
