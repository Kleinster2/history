# The Dawn of Everything

*The Dawn of Everything: A New History of Humanity* (2021) by David Graeber and [[David Wengrow]] is a sweeping reinterpretation of human social history. Its central claim: the conventional narrative of linear progress from small egalitarian bands to complex hierarchical states is wrong. Instead, early human societies were diverse, experimental, and politically self-conscious—people chose their social arrangements and frequently changed them. The book challenges the assumptions underlying most economic history, including much of this vault.

## Overview

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Authors | David Graeber (LSE, died 2020), [[David Wengrow]] (UCL) |
| Published | 2021 (posthumous for Graeber) |
| Core thesis | Human social evolution was not linear; early societies were politically diverse and self-aware |
| Scope | Deep prehistory through early civilizations |
| Reception | Bestseller; praised for ambition, debated on specifics |

## The Central Argument

### What the Book Rejects

| Conventional Claim | Graeber & Wengrow's Response |
|--------------------|------------------------------|
| Bands → tribes → chiefdoms → states | No evidence for universal stages |
| Agriculture caused hierarchy | Some farming societies were egalitarian; some foragers were hierarchical |
| Rousseau was right (noble savage) | Patronizing—denies agency to early peoples |
| Hobbes was right (nasty, brutish) | Equally wrong—projects modern assumptions backward |
| Inequality is the price of complexity | Many complex societies avoided deep inequality |

### What It Proposes

| Claim | Evidence |
|-------|----------|
| Early societies were politically experimental | Same groups shifted between arrangements seasonally |
| People consciously chose their systems | Schismogenesis—defining identity against neighbors |
| Three forms of domination | Control over violence, information, and individual charisma |
| "The state" bundles these three | But historically they were often separated |
| The real question | Not "how did inequality arise?" but "how did we get stuck?" |

## Three Freedoms

Graeber and Wengrow argue that early humans possessed three basic political freedoms, now largely lost:

| Freedom | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Freedom to move | Leave one's community and be welcomed elsewhere |
| Freedom to disobey | Refuse orders without punishment |
| Freedom to create | Build entirely new social arrangements |

The loss of these freedoms—not the rise of inequality per se—is what needs explaining.

## Key Evidence

### Seasonal Variation

| Society | One Season | Other Season |
|---------|-----------|-------------|
| Great Plains (Cheyenne, Lakota) | Dispersed, egalitarian bands | Aggregated under "Buffalo police" — militias with full coercive power during bison drives |
| Northwest Coast groups | Hierarchical potlatch societies | Dispersed, egalitarian |
| Implication | Same people chose different politics depending on context |

The Plains example is especially striking: during bison hunts, police could physically punish anyone who endangered the collective hunt. But as soon as the season ended, those groups disbanded and lost all coercive power. Membership in police groups rotated between clans — if you were dishing out hard justice one year, you'd be on the receiving end the next. Women often had important roles in allocating the accumulated surplus and in decisions about war and peace.

### The Indigenous Critique of Europe

| Element | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| [[Kandiaronk]] | Wendat statesman, warrior, diplomat, and formidable intellect |
| Context | "War of words" between Kandiaronk and French governor Frontenac near Montreal |
| Argument | Europeans lacked freedom; obsessed with property and obedience; allowed people to fall between the cracks |
| Publication | Baron de Lahontan's *Curious Dialogues with a Savage of Good Sense* (1703) |
| Confirmation | Leibniz wrote in a private letter that Kandiaronk was real, had visited Europe, and thought his society was better |
| Reception | Translated into multiple European languages, adapted into stage plays that ran for years |
| Lahontan-Leibniz connection | Lahontan befriended Leibniz at Hanover court after the book's success |
| Genre it spawned | Voltaire, Diderot, Graffigny (her *Letters of a Peruvian Woman* features Inca princess Zilia critiquing Europe) |
| Standard dismissal | Scholars assume these were pure European projections—"noble savage" trope used to shut down the idea that non-Europeans had intellectual achievements |
| Implication | Western political philosophy was partly a response to indigenous criticism |

### Rousseau and Turgot: The Fork

The book traces how the indigenous critique was absorbed into European thought—and then neutralized:

| Figure | Contribution | Effect |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| Rousseau | *Discourse on the Origins of Inequality* (1753) — fused indigenous critique with biblical fall narrative | Created the template: original freedom → agriculture → property → inequality → civilization |
| Anne Robert Turgot | Invented "modes of subsistence" classification (hunters → herders → farmers → commercial) | Provided the counter-move: those freedoms are appropriate to "simple" societies, not ours |
| Combined effect | Indigenous critiques were real and radical, but Turgot's framework made them seem primitive — freedom as a stage we evolved beyond |

Paul Hazard's *The Crisis of the European Mind* (1935) argues the Enlightenment was not a manifestation of European confidence but a mental crisis — societies that had only known monarchy and church dogma were suddenly exposed to a kaleidoscope of alternatives. The indigenous critique was genuinely destabilizing.

### The "Noble Savage" as Silencing Device

| Claim | Reality |
|-------|---------|
| Enlightenment dialogues were European projections | Lahontan's were based on real encounters; later ones drew on that content |
| "Noble savage" is a Rousseau concept | Rousseau didn't really have one; the trope was weaponized in the 1930s (Chinard) to dismiss indigenous intellectual contributions |
| Function | Calling something "noble savage romanticism" shuts down any suggestion that non-Europeans had progressive ideas |

### Cities Without States

| Site | Character | Significance |
|------|-----------|--------------|
| [[Göbekli Tepe]] | Monumental architecture by hunter-gatherers | Complexity without agriculture |
| Çatalhöyük | City of ~5,000-8,000 with no elite quarter | Urbanism without hierarchy |
| Ukrainian mega-sites (Taljanky, etc.) | Cities of 10,000+ with no central authority | Scale without the state |
| [[Poverty Point]] (Louisiana) | Earthworks as large as Uruk or Mohenjo-daro, built by non-farming peoples (~1600 BCE) | Urban scale without agriculture or commodity trade |
| Teotihuacan (later phase) | Social housing, reduced inequality | Possible egalitarian turn |

### Societies That Abandoned Agriculture

| Case | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Stonehenge-era Britain (~3300 BCE) | Societies that had experienced cereal agriculture abandoned it, returned to wild nuts and berries while keeping herding animals; no obvious climate crisis or crop failure — appears to be a choice |
| Great Plains confederacies (Cheyenne, Lakota) | Had practiced agriculture, then acquired horses from the Spanish and became nomadic again |
| American Southwest | Some groups returned to wild resource use before European contact |
| James Scott's observation | Cereal agriculture is uniquely amenable to state control — it roots people in place, is easy to quantify and tax; root vegetables are a classic form of "stealth farming" and tax evasion |

### Diverse Property Regimes

| Society | Property Arrangement |
|---------|---------------------|
| Northwest Coast | Elaborate property (names, songs, fishing rights) without agriculture |
| California foragers | Minimal property despite ecological abundance |
| Early Mesopotamia | Communal temple economies alongside private trade |
| Implication | Property rights did not evolve in a single sequence |

## The "Stuck" Question

The book's real puzzle is not "how did inequality arise?" but "how did we get stuck in rigid hierarchies?"

| Factor | How It Traps |
|--------|-------------|
| Sovereignty | Centralized violence becomes permanent |
| Bureaucracy | Information control creates dependency |
| Charismatic politics | Personal power institutionalizes |
| Combination | When all three merge in one institution (the state), escape becomes difficult |

## Capitalism as Empire, Not Free Trade

Wengrow extends the book's argument into the origins of capitalism. The standard narrative links capitalism to free markets and free trade. Wengrow argues the opposite:

| Claim | Evidence |
|-------|----------|
| Capitalism spread through free trade | Portuguese and Dutch destroyed existing free-trading civilizations in the Indian Ocean and replaced them with gunship-enforced monopolies |
| The VOC represented commercial innovation | The VOC monopolized the spice trade by controlling choke points (Straits of Malacca, Strait of Hormuz, Bab el-Mandeb) through military force |
| European maritime innovation was financial | The key European innovation was putting cannons on ships — gunpowder came from China, print technology from East Asia |
| The Banda Islands genocide | When the Dutch couldn't bully the Bandanese (who had no sultan — decisions were made collectively by merchant families), Admiral Coen exterminated the entire population and replaced them with enslaved laborers on plantations |
| International law emerged from principle | [[Hugo Grotius]]'s *Mare Liberum* (1609) — the supposed foundation of international law and freedom of the seas — was actually a legal justification for Dutch piracy against the Portuguese ship *Santa Catarina* |
| Labor discipline originated in factories | Plantation systems, work regimes, and "line managers" were created first in the colonies (Spanish silver mines in Bolivia, Portuguese sugar plantations) and then imported back to Europe under industrialization |

### The Iberian Union Trigger

| Event | Consequence |
|-------|------------|
| Portuguese succession crisis → Iberian Union (1580) | Spain/Portugal merged, cutting the Dutch off from spice trade they had been intermediating |
| Dutch response | Founded VOC, began direct competition for Indian Ocean trade routes |
| Chinese withdrawal from Indian Ocean (~1430s) | Ming dynasty ended overseas trade; Portuguese arrived ~80 years later into a power vacuum |
| Counterfactual | If China had maintained its maritime presence, Vasco da Gama would have encountered a Chinese thalassocracy — the entire trajectory of capitalism might have differed |

## Relevance to Economic History

### Points of Tension with This Vault

The vault's throughline—how did we get from subsistence to modernity?—assumes a broadly progressive arc. Graeber and Wengrow challenge this in several ways:

| Vault Assumption | Dawn of Everything Challenge |
|------------------|------------------------------|
| Progress is broadly linear | There were reversals, experiments, dead ends |
| Agriculture was transformative | It was adopted, abandoned, readopted in many places |
| Institutions evolved toward efficiency | Institutions reflected political choices, not optimization |
| The state was necessary for complexity | Complexity existed without states |
| Markets emerged naturally from exchange | Markets are one arrangement among many |

### Points of Agreement

| Shared Ground | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| Institutions matter | The book is fundamentally about institutional choice |
| Path dependence is real | Getting "stuck" is a version of institutional lock-in |
| Human agency drives history | People made choices, not just responded to pressures |
| Multiple equilibria | Different institutional arrangements can "work" |

### Connections to Other Frameworks

| Framework | Relationship to Dawn of Everything |
|-----------|-------------------------------------|
| [[Douglass North]] | North sees institutions as "rules of the game"—Graeber/Wengrow see them as political choices that can be unmade |
| [[Why Nations Fail]] | Acemoglu & Robinson's inclusive/extractive binary is too simple for Graeber/Wengrow |
| [[Violence and Social Orders]] | North/Wallis/Weingast's "limited access orders" overlap with Graeber/Wengrow's analysis of how domination consolidates |
| James Scott (*Against the Grain*) | Closest intellectual ally—Scott also emphasizes state coercion and the costs of civilization |
| [[Mancur Olson]] | Olson's "stationary bandit" model is the kind of simplistic state-origin story Graeber/Wengrow reject |

## Critiques

| Critique | Substance |
|----------|-----------|
| Cherry-picking evidence | Critics argue the book selects cases that fit and ignores counter-examples |
| Archaeological interpretation | Some evidence is more ambiguous than presented |
| Scale of claim | Sweeping thesis with uneven empirical support across regions |
| Romanticizing the past | Despite rejecting Rousseau, may recreate a version of the noble savage |
| Lack of mechanism | Explains what happened but not always why |
| Ignores material constraints | Downplays role of ecology, technology, and population pressure |

## Why It Matters for This Vault

The book doesn't invalidate the vault's throughline—economic progress did happen, and institutions did channel it. But it insists that the path was contingent, that alternatives existed, and that early humans were not passive subjects of evolutionary forces but active political agents. For a vault asking "how did we get here?", Graeber and Wengrow add a necessary corollary: **we could have gotten somewhere else.**
