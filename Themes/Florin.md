# Florin

The Florentine florin (*fiorino d'oro*) was medieval Europe's most trusted currency—a gold coin so reliable that 150 states copied it and merchants across the continent priced goods in it for centuries. Minted from 1252 to 1531 with almost no change in weight or purity, the florin demonstrated that monetary stability was possible and profitable. Its success rested not just on gold content but on the [[Florence|Florentine]] banking system that stood behind it.

| Authorized | October 31, 1252 |
| Last minted | 1531 |
| Duration | ~280 years |
| Mint location | Initially near Baptistery; later moved to Arno River area |
| Weight | 3.54 grams (54 grains) |
| Purity | 24 karat (~99.5% gold) |

## The Coin Itself

### Design

| Side | Image | Meaning |
|------|-------|---------|
| Obverse | Lily (*giglio*) | Symbol of Florence |
| Reverse | John the Baptist | Patron saint of Florence |
| Inscription | FLOR-ENTIA | The city's name |

The design remained virtually unchanged for 280 years—itself a statement of stability.

### Specifications

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Gold content | 3.53 grams pure gold |
| Diameter | ~20 mm |
| Fineness | .986+ |
| Value | 1 florin = 20 soldi = 240 denari |
| Purchasing power | ~150 days' wages for unskilled laborer |

### Why It Worked

| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Never debased | Trust accumulated over generations |
| Consistent | Same weight, purity for 280 years |
| Verifiable | Known specifications, easy to test |
| Backed by banking | Florentine banks accepted it everywhere |
| Network effects | Wide use made it more useful |
| Political networks | Angevin Crown (Sicily), Papacy facilitated early adoption |

### Appreciation Over Time

| Period | Exchange Rate |
|--------|---------------|
| 1252 | 1 florin = 1 lira |
| 1500 | 1 florin = ~7 lire |

The florin's stability amid fluctuating silver values caused it to appreciate against silver-based local currencies. This appreciation itself became proof of trustworthiness.

### Political Drivers

Recent scholarship emphasizes that the florin's success wasn't purely commercial. Florence's alliances with:
- **Angevin Crown** (Kingdom of Sicily)
- **The Papacy**

...integrated the florin into diplomatic, military, and ecclesiastical spheres. The coin gained prestige beyond mere economic utility—it became a tool of statecraft.

## Historical Context

### The Silver Predecessor

| Feature | Details |
|---------|---------|
| Name | Fiorino d'argento (silver florin) |
| First minted | c. 1237 |
| Metal | Silver |
| Purpose | Large-denomination trade coin |
| Limitation | Silver less stable, more debased elsewhere |
| Successor | Gold florin (1252) |

The silver florin came first—but silver coins were vulnerable to debasement across Europe. The leap to gold in 1252 gave Florence a currency that couldn't be confused with debased silver pennies elsewhere.

### Before the Florin

Medieval Europe ran on debased silver pennies:

| Problem | Consequence |
|---------|-------------|
| Only small coins | Large transactions difficult |
| Constant debasement | Value uncertain |
| No gold | Premium metal unavailable |
| Local currencies | Exchange costs high |

The florin was the first major gold coin in Western Europe since Rome. Genoa minted a gold coin (the genovino) the same year, but Florence's banking network gave the florin wider reach.

### Why 1252?

| Factor | Role |
|--------|------|
| Commercial revolution | Long-distance trade expanding |
| Florentine banking | System to back the coin |
| Gold supply | Trans-Saharan gold reaching Europe |
| Demand | Merchants needed reliable high-value coin |

## The Banking System Behind It

The florin's success was inseparable from Florentine banking:

| Innovation | Connection to Florin |
|------------|---------------------|
| Branch banking | Florins accepted at all branches |
| Bills of exchange | Denominated in florins |
| Letters of credit | Florin as unit of account |
| Double-entry bookkeeping | Florin accounts |

When you held a florin, you held a claim on this system. A Florentine bill of exchange payable in florins could be cashed in Bruges, London, or Rome.

### The Banking Families

| Family | Period | Role |
|--------|--------|------|
| Bardi | early 14th c. | Largest bank, florin everywhere |
| Peruzzi | early 14th c. | Second largest |
| Medici | 15th c. | Papal banking, florin standard |

## Spread and Imitation

### The Imitators

By the 14th century, ~150 European states minted florin copies:

| Imitator | Name | Notes |
|----------|------|-------|
| Hungary | Forint | Name survives today |
| Aragon | Florí | Spanish kingdoms |
| France | Florin | Royal coinage |
| England | Florin (1344) | Failed, withdrawn |
| Netherlands | Florijn | Later guilder/gulden |
| German states | Various | Many local versions |

### Why Copy?

| Reason | Mechanism |
|--------|-----------|
| Trust | Borrowed Florentine reputation |
| Convenience | Merchants knew the standard |
| Network | Integrated into existing trade |
| Simplicity | Known weight, easy exchange |

### The Florin Zone

The florin created a de facto monetary zone across Europe:

| Function | Florin's Role |
|----------|---------------|
| Unit of account | Prices quoted in florins |
| Reserve currency | Held for international trade |
| Settlement | Large transactions in florins |
| Benchmark | Other currencies valued against it |

## Competition: The Venetian Ducat

### The Rival

[[Venice]] minted the ducat in 1284:

| Feature | Florin | Ducat |
|---------|--------|-------|
| First minted | 1252 | 1284 |
| Weight | 3.54g | 3.54g |
| Purity | 24k | 24k |
| Design | Lily/Baptist | Doge/Christ |
| Backing | Banking system | Trade network |

### Coexistence

| Period | Relationship |
|--------|--------------|
| 1284-1350 | Florin dominant |
| 1350-1450 | Shared dominance |
| After 1450 | Ducat increasingly preferred |

The ducat eventually won because Venice's trade position outlasted Florence's banking dominance.

## Decline

### Why Minting Stopped

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| 1494 | Medici expelled, instability |
| 1494-1512 | Republic, then Medici restoration |
| 1527 | Sack of Rome, crisis |
| 1530 | Siege of Florence |
| 1531 | Last florin minted |
| 1532 | Republic ends, Medici duchy |

The florin died with the Republic. The political transformation ended the monetary tradition.

### But the Name Lived On

| Descendant | Location | Duration |
|------------|----------|----------|
| Gulden/guilder | Netherlands | to 2002 (euro) |
| Forint | Hungary | Current currency |
| Florin | Aruba | Current currency |
| Zloty | Poland | From "golden" |

## Economic Significance

### What the Florin Enabled

| Development | Florin's Role |
|-------------|---------------|
| Long-distance trade | Reliable payment |
| Banking expansion | Standard unit |
| Credit systems | Denominator for debts |
| Price discovery | Comparable values |
| Capital accumulation | Store of value |

### The Trust Premium

The florin traded at a premium because of trust:

| Florin Advantage | Value |
|------------------|-------|
| Known purity | No assay needed |
| No debasement risk | Value preserved |
| Wide acceptance | Liquid anywhere |
| Banking backup | Could convert/transfer |

Merchants paid more for this certainty.

## The Deeper Point

The florin proved that monetary stability was possible—and profitable. In an era of constant debasement, Florence demonstrated that keeping a currency pure for 280 years built trust, attracted trade, and created wealth.

The secret wasn't just gold content—it was *institutions*. The florin worked because the banking system, the guilds (especially the *Arte del Cambio*), and the Republic's government maintained standards. When one of those pillars fell (the Republic in 1532), the florin fell too.

This pattern repeats: the [[Dominant Currencies|Dutch guilder]] worked because of the Bank of Amsterdam; the pound sterling worked because of the Bank of England and the gold standard; the dollar works because of the Federal Reserve and US financial markets. Coins are metal, but currencies are systems.
