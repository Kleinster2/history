# Property Rights

Property rights—the legally and socially enforced claims to resources—underpin economic systems. From common lands to private property to intellectual property, how societies define and protect ownership shapes incentives, investment, and distribution. Property regimes have varied enormously across history and cultures; understanding these variations illuminates debates about economic institutions.

### The Deeper Point

Property rights are what make the future predictable enough to invest in. Without them, the rational strategy is extraction: take what you can before someone takes it from you. With secure property, the rational strategy shifts to investment: improve what you own, because you'll keep the returns. This is why [[Institutions and Progress|Douglass North]] placed property rights at the center of economic development—and why the vault's throughline (how ambition was channeled from taking to making) depends on understanding how property regimes evolved from communal to individual, from feudal to commercial, from physical to intellectual.
