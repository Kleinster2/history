# The Great Divergence

Why did the Industrial Revolution happen in Europe—specifically Britain—rather than in China, the Islamic world, or India? This question has generated one of the most important debates in economic history. The answer matters because it shapes how we understand economic development, global inequality, and whether the current world order was inevitable.

## The Puzzle

### The Situation Around 1500

| Region | Economic Position |
|--------|-------------------|
| China | World's largest economy |
| India | Major manufacturing (textiles) |
| Islamic world | Wealthy, sophisticated trade |
| Europe | Catching up, not leading |

### The Situation Around 1900

| Region | Economic Position |
|--------|-------------------|
| Europe/US | Dominant, industrialized |
| China | Impoverished, colonized |
| India | Deindustrialized colony |
| Islamic world | Relatively declined |

### The Question

**Why did Europe, a relative latecomer, end up dominating the global economy?**

|--------|------|------|------|
| China | 25% | 33% | 6% |
| India | 25% | 16% | 2% |
| Western Europe | 18% | 23% | 33% |
| Other | 32% | 28% | 59% |

*Figures approximate; sources vary*

| Netherlands | 120 | 200 | 400 |
| China | 100 | 90 | 60 |
| India | 90 | 70 | 50 |

*Rough estimates; much debated*

## Main Theories

### 1. Institutional Theories

**Argument:** Europe had better institutions for economic growth.

| Institution | European Feature | Effect |
|-------------|------------------|--------|
| Property rights | More secure | Investment incentive |
| Rule of law | More developed | Contract enforcement |
| Political competition | Fragmented states | Innovation incentive |
| Church | Independent | Limited despotism |
| Cities | Autonomous | Commercial freedom |

**Key Authors:** North & Thomas, Acemoglu & Robinson

**Problems:**
- China had stable property rights
- Islamic law protected commerce
- Causation unclear

### 2. Geographic Theories

**Argument:** Europe had geographic advantages.

| Factor | European Advantage |
|--------|-------------------|
| Atlantic position | Americas access |
| Coal location | Near population/transport |
| Climate | Temperate, varied |
| Rivers | Navigable, numerous |
| Size | Small enough for competition |

**Key Authors:** Diamond, Landes

**Problems:**
- China had coal, rivers
- Geography didn't change—why divergence when?
- Deterministic flavor

### 3. Cultural Theories

**Argument:** European culture favored capitalism.

| Factor | Claim |
|--------|-------|
| Protestant ethic | Weber's thesis |
| Scientific method | Empirical approach |
| Individualism | Risk-taking |
| Curiosity | Exploration |

**Key Authors:** Weber, Landes, Mokyr

**Problems:**
- China had sophisticated science
- Islamic Golden Age
- Correlation ≠ causation

### 4. Conjunctural Theories

**Argument:** Specific historical circumstances, not deep structures.

| Factor | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| New World resources | Silver, land, labor |
| Coal accessibility | Specifically British |
| Population dynamics | Labor costs |
| Timing | Contingent events |

**Key Authors:** Pomeranz, Frank

**Problems:**
- Minimizes earlier differences
- Still need to explain why Europe exploited opportunities

---

## The Pomeranz Thesis

### Core Argument

Until ~1750, Europe and China were roughly similar. Divergence was late and contingent.

| Factor | Europe | China |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Markets | Developed | Also developed |
| Life expectancy | Similar | Similar |
| Living standards | Similar | Similar |
| Agriculture | Similar productivity | Similar productivity |

### What Made the Difference?

| Factor | European Advantage |
|--------|-------------------|
| Coal | Near coasts/rivers in Britain |
| Colonies | Land, labor, resources from Americas |
| Contingency | Could have been otherwise |

### The "Ghost Acres"

| Source | What Europe Got |
|--------|-----------------|
| Americas | Land (cotton, sugar, timber) |
| Slave labor | Unpaid work |
| Silver | Purchasing power |
| New crops | Calories (potato) |

**Without colonies, Europe faces same constraints as China.**

## The China Question

### Why Not China First?

China in 1500 had:
- Largest economy
- Advanced technology
- Sophisticated markets
- Paper money (had it earlier)
- Proto-industrial production

### Explanations for Chinese Non-Industrialization

| Theory | Argument |
|--------|----------|
| High-level equilibrium trap | Labor too cheap, no machine incentive |
| Ming withdrawal | Turned inward after Zheng He |
| Bureaucratic state | Didn't support merchants |
| Confucian values | Commerce less valued |
| Mongol devastation | Interrupted development |
| Coal location | Far from population centers |

### The High-Level Equilibrium Trap

| Factor | China | Britain |
|--------|-------|---------|
| Population | Abundant | Growing but constrained |
| Labor cost | Low | High (post-Black Death) |
| Incentive | Labor-intensive methods | Labor-saving machines |
| Result | Involution | Innovation |

---

## The Britain-Specific Question

### Why Britain First (Not Netherlands, France, etc.)?

| Factor | British Advantage |
|--------|------------------|
| Coal | Abundant, accessible |
| Colonies | Large, exploitable |
| Atlantic trade | Major player |
| Political stability | After 1688 |
| Patent system | Innovation protected |
| Demand | Colonial markets |
| Skills | Artisan tradition |

### Coal and Energy

| Factor | Significance |
|--------|--------------|
| Wood shortage | [[Timber Crisis\|17th c. timber crisis]] |
| Coal substitution | Necessity driving innovation |
| [[Steam Engine]] | Originally for mine drainage |
| Iron smelting | Coke process (Darby) |
| Location | Near ports, rivers |

### Institutions (British-Specific)

| Institution | Effect |
|-------------|--------|
| Glorious Revolution | Parliamentary control |
| Bank of England | State finance |
| Joint-stock companies | Capital mobilization |
| Enclosure | Agricultural surplus |
| Patent law | Innovation incentive |

---

## The Role of Colonialism

### What Colonies Provided

| Resource | From Where | Use |
|----------|------------|-----|
| Silver | Americas | Purchase Asian goods |
| Sugar | Caribbean | Calories, trade |
| Cotton | Americas, India | Textile industry |
| Timber | Americas | Ships, construction |
| Labor | Africa (slave trade) | Production |

### Destruction of Competition

| Target | Method | Effect |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Indian textiles | Tariffs, forced markets | Deindustrialization |
| Chinese trade | Opium Wars | Forced opening |
| African economies | Slave trade | Devastation |
| American economies | Conquest | Destruction |

### Debate: How Central Was Colonialism?

| Position | Argument |
|----------|----------|
| Central | Europe couldn't have industrialized without colonial resources |
| Contributory | Helped but not essential |
| Minimal | Internal factors sufficient |

**This remains deeply contested.**

---

## Timing Questions

### When Did Divergence Begin?

| Claim | Date | Evidence |
|-------|------|----------|
| Very early | ~1000 CE | European institutions |
| Medieval | ~1300 CE | Commercial revolution |
| Early modern | ~1500 CE | Age of exploration |
| Late | ~1750 CE | Industrial Revolution |
| Very late | ~1800 CE | Only with industrialization |

### The "California School" vs. Traditional View

| Traditional | California School |
|-------------|------------------|
| Divergence ancient | Divergence late |
| Cultural/institutional | Conjunctural |
| Europe special | Europe lucky |
| Inevitable | Contingent |

---

## Implications

### For Understanding History

| Lesson | Implication |
|--------|-------------|
| Not inevitable | Could have been different |
| Multiple factors | No single cause |
| Contingency | Small changes, big effects |
| Violence | Conquest mattered |

### For Development Today

| Question | Relevance |
|----------|-----------|
| Can others industrialize? | Depends on what caused divergence |
| Path dependence | Historical advantages compound |
| Institutions | What can be changed |
| Geography | What can't be changed |

### For Global Order

| Question | Implication |
|----------|-------------|
| Was Western dominance deserved? | Depends on causation |
| Was it extractive? | Colonial question |
| Is it permanent? | History says nothing is |

---

## What's Still Debated

| Question | Status |
|----------|--------|
| When did divergence start? | Unresolved |
| What caused it? | Multiple theories |
| Was it contingent? | Contested |
| Could China have industrialized? | Debated |
| How central was colonialism? | Deeply contested |
| Is the question even right? | Some challenge framing |

---

## Synthesis: What We Can Say

| Claim | Confidence |
|-------|------------|
| Europe was not always ahead | High |
| Multiple factors mattered | High |
| Colonialism played a role | High |
| Coal mattered for Britain | High |
| Institutions mattered somehow | Medium |
| Contingency was significant | Medium |
| Single-cause explanations fail | High |

### A Reasonable View

The Great Divergence resulted from:
1. **Specific conjuncture** of coal, colonies, and markets in Britain
2. **Institutional factors** that allowed exploitation of these
3. **Path dependence** as early advantages compounded
4. **Colonial extraction** that transferred resources and destroyed competitors
5. **Contingency** that makes it hard to separate from counterfactuals

**We cannot fully separate these factors.**

## The Deeper Point

The question isn't "why did Europe industrialize first?" but "why did sustained growth happen only once?" Every earlier efflorescence ([[Song China Economy|Song China]], [[Islamic Economy|Abbasid Baghdad]], [[Roman Economy|Rome]]) produced growth that was cyclical, not self-sustaining—eventually hitting Malthusian ceilings that returned per-capita income to subsistence. The [[Institutions and Progress|institutional]] thesis argues that Britain's specific combination (IP protection, capital markets, low entry barriers, competitive political fragmentation, scientific culture) crossed a threshold where [[Innovation Economics|innovating]] was permanently more profitable than renting. Pomeranz's challenge (coal access, New World resources) shows this wasn't inevitable—it required contingent geographic advantages too. The deepest lesson: the Great Divergence wasn't one country getting ahead in a race all countries were running. It was one country breaking the ceiling that had limited *all* previous societies. Every subsequent industrialization—Germany, Japan, Korea, China—is catch-up to that single breakout, made possible because the institutional formula was now visible and copiable. The question for our era is whether the formula requires updating: the institutions that enabled the first transition (fossil fuel-powered growth) may be inadequate for the next one (sustainable growth within planetary limits).
