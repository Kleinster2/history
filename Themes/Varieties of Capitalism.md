# Varieties of Capitalism

Not all capitalisms are the same. The United States and Germany are both rich, both capitalist, both democratic—yet their firms are governed differently, their workers trained differently, their banks lend differently, and their companies compete differently. The "varieties of capitalism" framework explains why: national economies are institutional packages where corporate governance, labor relations, education, finance, and inter-firm relations form complementary clusters. Understanding these varieties is essential to understanding why the same business strategy succeeds in one country and fails in another—and why institutional reform is so difficult.

## Overview

### The Core Insight

| Observation | Implication |
|-------------|-------------|
| Institutions cluster | Corporate governance, labor, education, finance fit together |
| Clusters are stable | Complementarities resist piecemeal change |
| Multiple equilibria | Different packages can achieve high performance |
| Comparative advantage | Different systems excel at different things |

### The Hall & Soskice Framework (2001)

| Type | Coordination Mechanism | Examples |
|------|------------------------|----------|
| Liberal Market Economies (LME) | Market competition, arm's-length | US, UK, Australia, Canada |
| Coordinated Market Economies (CME) | Institutions, relationships | Germany, Japan, Scandinavia |
| Mixed/Mediterranean | Hybrid, state role | France, Italy, Spain |
| Developmental State | State direction | Korea, Taiwan, Singapore |

## Liberal Market Economies (LME)

### The American/Anglo Model

| Domain | LME Approach |
|--------|--------------|
| Corporate governance | Shareholder primacy, hostile takeovers possible |
| Labor | Flexible, at-will employment, weak unions |
| Skills | General education, poaching from competitors |
| Finance | Equity markets, venture capital, quarterly focus |
| Inter-firm | Arm's-length, contracts, competition |

### How the Pieces Fit

| Institution | Why It Fits |
|-------------|-------------|
| Fluid labor markets | Firms can hire/fire → invest in general skills |
| General skills | Workers mobile → fluid labor markets |
| Equity finance | Short-term focus → need to cut costs fast → flexible labor |
| Hostile takeovers | Discipline managers → maximize shareholder value |
| Weak unions | Enable flexibility, accept inequality |

### What LMEs Excel At

| Strength | Mechanism |
|----------|-----------|
| Radical innovation | Risk capital, fail fast, high rewards |
| New industries | Biotech, software, internet |
| Entrepreneurship | Easy entry, exit |
| Reallocation | Capital and labor move to new sectors |

### What LMEs Struggle With

| Weakness | Mechanism |
|----------|-----------|
| Incremental innovation | Workers won't share knowledge if job insecure |
| Training investment | Why train if workers leave? |
| Inequality | Flexibility means some lose |
| Short-termism | Quarterly earnings over long-term investment |

---

## Coordinated Market Economies (CME)

### The German/Japanese Model

| Domain | CME Approach |
|--------|--------------|
| Corporate governance | Stakeholder model, banks, blockholders |
| Labor | Strong unions, codetermination, job security |
| Skills | Vocational training, firm-specific skills |
| Finance | Bank relationships, patient capital |
| Inter-firm | Associations, networks, cooperation |

### How the Pieces Fit

| Institution | Why It Fits |
|-------------|-------------|
| Job security | Workers invest in firm-specific skills |
| Firm-specific skills | Makes workers valuable → justifies job security |
| Patient capital | Long-term investment → need stable workforce |
| Codetermination | Workers have voice → accept wage restraint |
| Employer associations | Coordinate training, prevent poaching |

### What CMEs Excel At

| Strength | Mechanism |
|----------|-----------|
| Incremental innovation | Workers share knowledge, improve processes |
| Quality manufacturing | Skilled workers, long-term orientation |
| Export competitiveness | High quality, reliable delivery |
| Worker training | Firms invest, workers stay |

### What CMEs Struggle With

| Weakness | Mechanism |
|----------|-----------|
| Radical innovation | Harder to disrupt, vested interests |
| New industries | Slow to reallocate |
| Entrepreneurship | Less fluid, harder entry |
| Adjustment | Painful when old industries decline |

## The German Model in Detail

### Institutional Architecture

| Institution | Function |
|-------------|----------|
| [[German Business Model\|Mittelstand]] | Family-owned specialists, long-term focus |
| Codetermination | Workers on supervisory boards |
| Works councils | Plant-level worker voice |
| Hausbank | Relationship banking, patient capital |
| Dual vocational training | Apprenticeship + classroom |
| Employer associations | Coordinate wages, training |

### Why It Works Together

| Complementarity | Logic |
|-----------------|-------|
| Apprenticeship + job security | Train because workers stay |
| Codetermination + wage restraint | Voice instead of exit |
| Patient capital + long-term investment | Banks don't demand quarterly returns |
| Associations + coordination | Prevent destructive competition |

### Performance

| Measure | Germany |
|---------|---------|
| Export surplus | Consistently positive |
| Manufacturing share | Higher than US/UK |
| Inequality | Lower than LMEs |
| [[Japanese Stagnation\|Adjustment speed]] | Slower but more consensual |

---

## The Japanese Model

### Institutional Architecture

| Institution | Function |
|-------------|----------|
| [[Japanese Economic Miracle\|Keiretsu]] | Cross-shareholding networks |
| Lifetime employment | Core workers only |
| Seniority wages | Pay rises with tenure |
| Enterprise unions | Company-specific |
| Main bank | Monitoring, rescue |
| MITI/METI | Industrial policy coordination |

### Distinctive Features

| Feature | Logic |
|---------|-------|
| Horizontal keiretsu | Mitsubishi, Mitsui groups share banks, trading companies |
| Vertical keiretsu | Toyota's supplier networks |
| Amakudari | Bureaucrats to business |
| Consensus decision-making | Ringi system |

### Crisis and Adaptation

| Period | Character |
|--------|-----------|
| 1950s-1980s | Catch-up success |
| 1990s-2000s | Stagnation, system questioned |
| 2010s+ | Partial reform, corporate governance changes |

---

## Developmental States

### The [[Korean Chaebol\|Korean]]/Taiwanese Model

| Feature | Mechanism |
|---------|-----------|
| State direction | Government picks industries, firms |
| Conditional support | Meet export targets or lose access |
| Financial repression | Cheap credit to chosen sectors |
| Education investment | Human capital for industry |
| Rapid sequencing | Light → heavy → high-tech |

### How It Differs

| Compared to CME | Developmental State |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| Coordination by | State, not associations |
| Labor | Suppressed initially |
| Finance | Directed credit |
| Goal | Catch-up industrialization |

### The Transition Challenge

| Phase | Character |
|-------|-----------|
| Catch-up | State direction works |
| Frontier | Need more [[Creative Destruction\|creative destruction]] |
| Transition | Liberalize but keep strengths |

---

## Other Varieties

### Mediterranean/Mixed

| Country | Character |
|---------|-----------|
| France | State-led capitalism, grands corps, national champions |
| Italy | Family capitalism, industrial districts, North-South divide |
| Spain | Late industrialization, banking-industry links |

### Nordic

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Coordinated labor | Centralized bargaining |
| Generous welfare | Security enables flexibility |
| Active labor policy | Retrain, don't protect jobs |
| High trust | Social capital |

### Emerging Varieties

| Region | Character |
|--------|-----------|
| China | State capitalism, SOEs + private, political control |
| India | Family groups + new economy, partial liberalization |
| Russia | Oligarchic capitalism, weak property rights |

---

## Institutional Complementarities

### Why Systems Are Sticky

| Mechanism | Logic |
|-----------|-------|
| Complementarity | Each institution works because others exist |
| Path dependence | History constrains choices |
| Political coalitions | Winners defend current system |
| Expectations | Actors plan based on stable institutions |

### Failed Reforms

| Attempt | Outcome |
|---------|---------|
| Thatcher labor reform | Worked because whole LME package changed |
| German Agenda 2010 | Partial reform, preserved core |
| Japanese reforms | Slow, incomplete |
| Lesson | Need to change multiple institutions together |

### Convergence Debate

| Position | Argument |
|----------|----------|
| Convergence | Globalization forces all toward LME |
| Persistence | CMEs still competitive in different niches |
| Hybrid | Some convergence, but varieties persist |
| Evidence | Both patterns visible |

---

## Business Strategy Implications

### What Works Where

| Strategy | Best Fit |
|----------|----------|
| Radical innovation | LME (can hire/fire, risk capital) |
| Incremental innovation | CME (worker commitment, patient capital) |
| Mass production | Either (but different how) |
| Craft production | CME (skills, networks) |
| Platform business | LME (scale, network effects, flexibility) |

### Multinational Challenges

| Challenge | Logic |
|-----------|-------|
| Transferring practices | Home country practices may not fit |
| Hybrid strategies | Adapt to local institutions |
| [[Global Supply Chains\|Supply chain design]] | Locate activities where institutions fit |
| Labor standards | Different baseline expectations |

---

## Critiques and Extensions

### Limitations of VoC

| Critique | Response |
|----------|----------|
| Too binary | LME/CME is ideal type, not description |
| Static | Misses change within types |
| Ignores politics | Power matters, not just efficiency |
| Firm-centric | What about workers, consumers, citizens? |

### Extensions

| Development | Focus |
|-------------|-------|
| Growth regimes | Export-led vs. consumption-led |
| Financialization | LMEs more affected |
| Welfare states | How business systems link to social protection |
| Emerging economies | New varieties beyond original framework |

## The Deeper Point

The "varieties of capitalism" framework is the vault's key to understanding why [[Institutions and Progress|institutional]] quality doesn't mean one thing. The American and German business environments both channel [[Entrepreneurship|entrepreneurial]] ambition into production rather than extraction—but through radically different institutional packages that produce radically different outcomes. LMEs excel at [[Creative Destruction|creative destruction]]: fluid labor markets, risk capital, and weak employment protection enable rapid reallocation to new industries (biotech, software, internet). CMEs excel at incremental innovation: job security, vocational training, and patient capital encourage workers to share knowledge and improve processes (precision manufacturing, machine tools, automotive). The deeper insight is *complementarity*: each institution works because the others exist. German apprenticeship makes sense because workers stay; workers stay because firms invest in them; firms invest because banks provide patient capital; banks provide patient capital because blockholders monitor managers. Remove one element and the system degrades. This explains why institutional reform is so difficult and why copying individual policies (German apprenticeship, American venture capital) without the supporting institutional package typically fails. The same [[State Capacity|state capacity]] produces different outcomes depending on which variety of capitalism it governs. There is no single optimal business environment—only institutional packages that cohere internally and produce different comparative advantages.
