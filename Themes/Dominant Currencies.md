# Dominant Currencies

Throughout history, one currency has typically dominated international trade—accepted everywhere, held as reserves, used to price commodities. The succession tells a story of economic hegemony: Florentine florin → Venetian ducat → Spanish dollar → Dutch guilder → British pound → American dollar. Each transition followed a shift in economic and military power, usually with a lag of decades. Understanding why currencies rise and fall illuminates the relationship between money, trade, and geopolitical power.

## What Makes a Currency Dominant

### Requirements

| Factor | Why It Matters |
|--------|----------------|
| Economic size | Large economy = large trade flows |
| Trade centrality | Hub of international commerce |
| Military power | Can protect trade routes, enforce contracts |
| Stable institutions | Predictable rules, property rights |
| Deep financial markets | Easy to borrow, lend, exchange |
| Convertibility | Can exchange freely for goods or other currencies |
| Network effects | Once dominant, use reinforces use |

### Functions of a Dominant Currency

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Vehicle currency | Used for transactions between third parties |
| Invoice currency | Prices quoted in this currency |
| Reserve currency | Held by central banks, merchants |
| Anchor currency | Others peg to it |
| Safe haven | Flight to safety in crises |

### The Incumbency Advantage

| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Network effects | Everyone uses it because everyone uses it |
| Infrastructure | Markets, contracts, habits built around it |
| Inertia | Costly to switch |
| Lag | Dominant currency persists after economy declines |

## What History Suggests

### For Dollar Dominance

| Lesson | Implication |
|--------|-------------|
| Lags are long | Dollar could persist decades after US relative decline |
| Crises matter | Major shock needed to trigger transition |
| Alternatives needed | Must be somewhere else to go |
| Institutions matter | Not just economic size |
| Network effects | Self-reinforcing until they're not |

### For Potential Successors

| Requirement | Current Status |
|-------------|----------------|
| Economic size | China approaching US |
| Trade centrality | China major trading partner to most |
| Financial markets | China's are restricted, shallow |
| Convertibility | Renminbi not freely convertible |
| Institutions | Rule of law, property rights questioned |
| Military | US still dominant |

### The Key Insight

Currency dominance follows economic dominance—but with a lag, and only if the rising power develops the financial infrastructure and institutional credibility to support a reserve currency. China has the economic size but lacks the financial openness. The EU has the institutions but lacks political unity. The dollar's dominance may persist not because America is rising but because alternatives aren't ready.
