# Trade Blocs

Trade blocs fragment and organize the global economy. From customs unions to free trade areas, from the EU's deep integration to loose preferential agreements, regional trade arrangements have proliferated since 1945. They promise efficiency within, but risk division without. Are they stepping stones to global free trade or stumbling blocks?

## Overview

| Common market | Free factor movement | EU single market |
| Economic union | Harmonized policies | Eurozone |

### The Numbers
