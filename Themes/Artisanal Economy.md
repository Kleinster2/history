# Artisanal Economy

Before factories, skilled craftsmen—artisans—were the economy's productive core. Blacksmiths, weavers, carpenters, printers produced most manufactured goods through tacit skills learned over years of apprenticeship. Artisans were entrepreneurs within [[Guild Economics|guild]] constraints, taking pride in their work and identity in their trade. Industrialization destroyed this world: machines replaced craft knowledge, factories replaced workshops, wage labor replaced mastery. The Luddites weren't anti-technology—they were defending a way of life.

## Overview

|---------|-------------|
| Definition | Skilled manual production |
| Organization | Workshop, guild, family |
| Skill | Tacit, learned by doing |
| Duration | Pre-industrial through 19th c. |

## The Deeper Point

The artisanal economy reveals what [[Institutions and Progress|industrialization]] destroyed as well as created. Artisans were [[Business Firm|entrepreneurs]] in their workshops—owning tools, buying materials, selling products, training successors. They exercised skill built over years of learning, took pride in quality, and belonged to communities of practice. The [[Industrial Revolution]] made their skills worthless. The weaver's tacit knowledge of tension and thread counted for nothing against the power loom. The printer's lifetime of craft was obsolete when steam presses arrived. Luddites weren't opponents of progress—they were defending a world where work meant skill, where craftsmen controlled their time, where identity came from mastery. The factory offered cheaper goods but also wage labor, factory discipline, and work that was "just a job." The trade-off was real: consumer abundance versus producer autonomy. Modern artisanal revival—craft beer, handmade goods, maker culture—reflects nostalgia for what was lost. But it operates in niches precisely because industrial methods won the mass market. The artisanal economy's lesson: progress creates losers as well as winners, and the losers were often skilled workers whose human capital became obsolete.
