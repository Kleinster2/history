# Reversal of Fortune

One of the most striking patterns in economic history: places that were rich in 1500 are often poor today, while places that were poor in 1500 became rich. Mexico and Peru—seats of the Aztec and Inca empires—are middle-income at best; Massachusetts and New South Wales—peripheral backwaters in 1500—are wealthy. This "reversal of fortune" is the empirical foundation of the institutional theory of development, formalized by Acemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson (AJR). The explanation isn't geography, culture, or resources—it's the institutions colonizers created, which channeled ambition into production or extraction depending on local conditions.

## Overview

### The Puzzle

| 1500 | 2000 | Reversal |
|------|------|----------|
| Aztec Empire (rich, urbanized) | Mexico (middle income) | Decline |
| Inca Empire (rich, organized) | Peru (middle income) | Decline |
| Mughal India (25% world GDP) | India (lower-middle income) | Decline |
| Massachusetts (hunter-gatherers) | United States (richest) | Rise |
| Australia (hunter-gatherers) | Australia (wealthy) | Rise |
| Canada (sparse population) | Canada (wealthy) | Rise |

### The Pattern

| Pre-colonial density | Colonial institution | Long-run outcome |
|---------------------|---------------------|------------------|
| High population | Extractive | Poor today |
| Low population | Settler | Rich today |
| Urbanized | Exploitation | Stagnation |
| Empty | Property rights | Growth |

## The AJR Thesis

### Core Argument

| Step | Logic |
|------|-------|
| 1. Settler mortality | Europeans faced disease in tropics |
| 2. Settlement patterns | Where mortality high → didn't settle |
| 3. Institutional choice | Non-settlement → extractive institutions |
| 4. Persistence | Colonial institutions lasted centuries |
| 5. Result | Extractive → poor; inclusive → rich |

### The Mortality Mechanism

| Settler Mortality | Example | Institutional Response |
|-------------------|---------|----------------------|
| Very high | Congo, Nigeria, Indonesia | Pure extraction |
| High | Mexico, Peru, India | Exploitation with local elites |
| Low | US, Canada, Australia, NZ | European-style settlement |
| Very low | Neo-Europes | Replica institutions |

### What Made Colonies "Extractive"?

| Feature | Mechanism |
|---------|-----------|
| Forced labor | Mita, encomienda, corvée |
| Plantation systems | Slave labor, cash crops |
| Monopoly trade | East India Companies |
| Taxation | Revenue extraction, not services |
| Property rights | Insecure, subject to confiscation |
| Political exclusion | Narrow elite, no representation |

### What Made Colonies "Settler"?

| Feature | Mechanism |
|---------|-----------|
| Land ownership | Distributed to settlers |
| Political participation | Colonial assemblies |
| Rule of law | Courts, property protection |
| Economic freedom | Open entry, trade |
| Education | For settler population |
| Constraint on executives | Representative institutions |

## The Evidence

### Cross-Country Regressions

| Finding | Interpretation |
|---------|---------------|
| GDP today correlates with 1500 urbanization | Negatively—reversal |
| GDP today correlates with settler mortality | Negatively—mortality matters |
| Controlling for geography | Institutions still significant |
| Controlling for culture | Institutions still significant |

### Natural Experiments

| Case | Evidence |
|------|----------|
| North vs. South Korea | Same geography, same culture, different institutions |
| East vs. West Germany | Same people, different systems |
| Nogales (US vs. Mexico) | Same city, border creates divergence |
| Haiti vs. Dominican Republic | Same island, different colonial legacy |

### Within-Country Variation

| Country | Pattern |
|---------|---------|
| Mexico | Mita regions poorer today |
| Peru | Encomienda areas lagged |
| Colombia | Slave plantation areas less developed |
| India | Direct British rule vs. princely states |

## Mechanisms of Persistence

### Why Extractive Institutions Survived Independence

| Mechanism | How It Works |
|-----------|--------------|
| Elite capture | Independence transferred power to local elites |
| Property distribution | Unequal land stayed unequal |
| Human capital | Thin education for masses |
| State capacity | Weak administrative inheritance |
| Political institutions | Restricted franchise continued |

### Self-Reinforcing Dynamics

| Cycle | Pattern |
|-------|---------|
| Inequality → politics | Elites block redistribution |
| Poor education → low productivity | Poverty trap |
| Weak states → insecurity | Can't enforce property rights |
| Extraction → no investment | Why invest if confiscated? |
| No growth → no tax base | Weak states stay weak |

### Critical Junctures

| Moment | Possibility |
|--------|-------------|
| Independence | Could have reformed (usually didn't) |
| Land reform | Some countries broke the pattern |
| Education expansion | Human capital accumulation |
| Political opening | When inclusion happened |

## The Success Cases

### Why Some Reversed the Reversal

| Country | Mechanism |
|---------|-----------|
| Japan | Never colonized; Meiji reform |
| South Korea | Land reform, education, export discipline |
| Taiwan | Land reform under KMT |
| Botswana | Pre-colonial institutions + diamonds managed well |
| Mauritius | Ethnic compromise, diversification |

### What They Had in Common

| Factor | Pattern |
|--------|---------|
| Land reform | Broke colonial inequality |
| Education investment | Human capital broadly |
| State capacity | Could implement policy |
| Export orientation | Discipline from competition |
| Political settlement | Enough inclusion for stability |

## Critiques and Debates

### Geography Still Matters?

| Critique | Response |
|----------|----------|
| Tropics inherently harder | But Singapore, Hong Kong are tropical |
| Disease burden | Partly endogenous to institutions |
| Landlocked | Matters, but institutions more |
| Resources | Resource curse is institutional |

### Culture Matters?

| Critique | Response |
|----------|----------|
| Weber's Protestant ethic | Doesn't explain East Asia |
| Trust and social capital | Endogenous to institutions |
| Work ethic variation | Can change with institutions |

### Timing Questions

| Critique | Issue |
|----------|-------|
| When did divergence start? | Pomeranz says late (1800s) |
| Were colonies poor before colonizers? | Measurement problems |
| Alternative histories? | Would Africa have developed differently? |

### The Identification Problem

| Critique | Response |
|----------|----------|
| Reverse causality? | Rich places → good institutions |
| Omitted variables? | Something else driving both |
| AJR's response | Settler mortality as instrument |
| Validity debate | Ongoing |

| Singapore | Trading post, then settler | Wealthy |
| Hong Kong | Trading post | Wealthy |

## The Deeper Point

The reversal of fortune is the vault's most powerful demonstration of [[Institutions and Progress|institutional]] determination of economic outcomes. Places with dense populations and sophisticated pre-colonial civilizations became extraction targets; places with sparse populations became settlement destinations. The institutions colonizers created—extractive or inclusive—persisted for centuries after independence, channeling [[Entrepreneurship|entrepreneurial]] ambition in radically different directions. In Mexico, the ambitious person became a hacendado, a political fixer, or emigrated; in Massachusetts, they became a merchant, manufacturer, or innovator. Same human talent, different institutional channels, different outcomes. The critique has force: geography, culture, and contingency all matter, and the AJR thesis is strongest as framework, not monocausal explanation. But the core insight—that colonial institutions were designed either for extraction or production, and that design persisted—explains more of the variance in modern development than any alternative. The [[Great Divergence]] between Europe and Asia is one story; the divergence *within* the colonized world is another, and the reversal of fortune is its signature pattern. [[Development Economics|Development]] is not about catching up to a universal path; it's about escaping institutional traps that were set centuries ago.
