# Business Cycle Theory

Economies don't grow smoothly—they boom and bust. The business cycle, alternating between expansion and contraction, has been a feature of capitalist economies since industrialization. Understanding why cycles happen has been central to economic theory since the 19th century. From classical theories of overproduction to Keynes's animal spirits to modern debates about shocks and policy, business cycle theory shapes how we respond to recessions and manage prosperity.

## Overview

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Definition | Regular fluctuations in economic activity |
| Phases | Expansion, peak, contraction, trough |
| Duration | 2-10 years typically |
| Severity | Mild recessions to depressions |
| Key question | Can cycles be smoothed? |

## Anatomy of the Cycle

### Phases

| Phase | Characteristics |
|-------|-----------------|
| Expansion | Growing output, falling unemployment |
| Peak | Maximum activity, overheating signs |
| Contraction | Falling output, rising unemployment |
| Trough | Minimum activity, recovery begins |

### US Business Cycles (Post-WWII)

| Dates | Duration (Months) | Severity |
|-------|-------------------|----------|
| 1948-49 | 11 | Mild |
| 1953-54 | 10 | Mild |
| 1957-58 | 8 | Moderate |
| 1960-61 | 10 | Mild |
| 1969-70 | 11 | Mild |
| 1973-75 | 16 | Severe |
| 1980 | 6 | Moderate |
| 1981-82 | 16 | Severe |
| 1990-91 | 8 | Mild |
| 2001 | 8 | Mild |
| 2007-09 | 18 | Severe |
| 2020 | 2 | Sharp but brief |

### Long-Term Pattern

| Era | Cycle Characteristics |
|-----|----------------------|
| Pre-1914 | Frequent, severe, no policy response |
| Interwar | Most severe (Great Depression) |
| 1945-1970 | Mild, well-managed |
| 1970s-1980s | Stagflation challenges |
| 1985-2007 | "Great Moderation" |
| 2008-present | Severe crises, strong policy response |

## Classical Theories

### Say's Law

| Claim | "Supply creates its own demand" |
|-------|--------------------------------|
| Implication | General overproduction impossible |
| Cycles explained by | Real shocks, maladjustment |
| Policy | Markets self-correct |

### Underconsumption

| Claim | Demand insufficient for production |
|-------|-----------------------------------|
| Mechanism | Wages too low, saving too high |
| Authors | Malthus, Hobson |
| Solution | Redistribute to consumers |

### Austrian Theory

| Core idea | Credit expansion distorts production |
|-----------|-------------------------------------|
| Mechanism | Artificially low rates → malinvestment |
| Bust | Reveals errors, requires liquidation |
| Policy | Don't intervene, let markets clear |
| Authors | Mises, Hayek |

---

## Keynesian Theory

### The Keynesian Revolution

| Innovation | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| Aggregate demand | Central determinant of output |
| Equilibrium unemployment | Economy can settle below full employment |
| Animal spirits | Psychology affects investment |
| Multiplier | Spending creates more spending |

### Demand Deficiency

| Mechanism | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Consumption falls | Precautionary saving |
| Investment collapses | Uncertainty, falling profits |
| Self-reinforcing | Less spending → less income → less spending |
| Equilibrium | Below full employment |

### Policy Response

| Tool | Mechanism |
|------|-----------|
| Fiscal stimulus | Government spending fills demand gap |
| Monetary policy | Lower rates encourage borrowing |
| Automatic stabilizers | Taxes fall, transfers rise in recession |
| Deficits | Acceptable to prevent depression |

### IS-LM Framework (Hicks)

| Component | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| IS curve | Investment-Savings equilibrium |
| LM curve | Liquidity-Money equilibrium |
| Intersection | Determines output and interest rates |
| Policy analysis | Shift curves with policy |

---

## Monetarism

### Friedman's Critique

| Argument | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Money matters | Monetary policy dominates fiscal |
| [[Great Depression]] | Fed error (tight money) caused depth |
| Long and variable lags | Discretionary policy destabilizes |
| Rules over discretion | Stable money growth |

### Monetary Policy

| Claim | Implication |
|-------|-------------|
| Inflation is always monetary | Control money supply |
| Natural rate of unemployment | Policy can't permanently lower |
| Expectations matter | Policy effective only if surprise |

---

## New Classical Economics

### Rational Expectations

| Innovation | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| Expectations forward-looking | People use all information |
| Policy ineffectiveness | Anticipated policy doesn't affect output |
| Only surprises matter | Unexpected policy has real effects |
| Authors | Lucas, Sargent |

### Real Business Cycle Theory

| Core idea | Cycles driven by real (not monetary) shocks |
|-----------|---------------------------------------------|
| Technology shocks | Random productivity changes |
| Optimal response | Agents adjust labor, saving optimally |
| Policy | Intervention harmful, cycles efficient |
| Implication | Recessions are optimal adjustment |

### Critique of Keynesianism

| Challenge | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Microfoundations | Macro needs individual optimization |
| Lucas critique | Policy changes alter behavior |
| Time consistency | Credibility matters for policy |

---

## New Keynesian Economics

### Synthesis

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Microfoundations | Accept RBC methodology |
| Market imperfections | Sticky prices, wages |
| Nominal rigidities | Why money affects output |
| Policy effective | Especially at zero lower bound |

### Key Mechanisms

| Mechanism | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| Price stickiness | Firms don't adjust prices instantly |
| Wage stickiness | Labor contracts, fairness norms |
| Financial frictions | Credit constraints amplify shocks |
| Multiple equilibria | Coordination failures possible |

### Taylor Rule

| Prescription | Adjust rates based on inflation and output |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Formula | Rate = neutral + α(inflation gap) + β(output gap) |
| Influence | Guide for central banks |
| Limitation | Zero lower bound |

## Financial Cycles

### Minsky's Financial Instability

| Phase | Financing Type |
|-------|----------------|
| Hedge | Income covers interest and principal |

### Credit Cycles

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Leverage | Debt amplifies booms and busts |
| Collateral | Asset prices affect borrowing capacity |
| Pro-cyclical | Credit expands in booms, contracts in busts |
| [[Post-2008 Economy]] | Financial cycle amplified recession |

### Macroprudential Policy

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Capital requirements | Build buffers in good times |
| Loan-to-value limits | Constrain housing leverage |

## Contemporary Debates

### Secular Stagnation

|---------|-----------------------------------|
| Solutions | QE, forward guidance, fiscal policy |
| Unconventional tools | Asset purchases, yield curve control |
| Effectiveness | Debated |

---

## Policy Responses

### Fiscal Policy

| [[Post-2008 Economy\|2008]] | Stimulus, then premature austerity | Slow recovery |
| [[COVID Economic Impact\|2020]] | Massive fiscal/monetary | Fast recovery, inflation |

## The Deeper Point

Business cycle theory reflects deeper disagreements about how economies work. If markets clear efficiently, cycles are optimal responses to real shocks, and intervention is harmful. If markets fail—due to sticky prices, coordination problems, financial fragility—cycles represent waste that policy can address. The evidence from the [[Great Depression]] and [[Post-2008 Economy\|2008 crisis]] suggests markets don't self-correct quickly enough to prevent enormous human costs. But the [[COVID Economic Impact\|COVID response]] shows that aggressive policy creates its own problems (inflation). The [[ZIRP Era]] blurred the line between stabilization and long-term distortion. The deepest insight may be Minsky's: stability itself is destabilizing. Success breeds confidence, confidence breeds leverage, leverage breeds fragility. This means [[Central Banking\|central banks]] face an impossible task: prevent crises without creating the conditions for the next one. Business cycle theory remains contested because the question it addresses—can we have [[Capitalism]] without crises?—may not have a satisfying answer.
