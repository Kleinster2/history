# Scramble for Africa

The Scramble for Africa (roughly 1880-1914) saw European powers partition nearly the entire African continent among themselves in just three decades. The Berlin Conference (1884-1885) established rules for this division, though Africans were excluded from decisions about their lands. This rapid colonization transformed African societies, economies, and political structures with effects persisting today.
