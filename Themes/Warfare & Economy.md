# Warfare & Economy

War and economy are inextricably linked. Wars are fought for economic gain—land, resources, trade routes, tribute. Wars are funded by economic surplus—taxation, loans, plunder. Wars transform economies—destruction, reconstruction, innovation. From ancient tribute empires to modern military-industrial complexes, understanding economic history means understanding how societies organized violence and paid for it.
