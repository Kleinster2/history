# Corvée and Obligation Labor

Compulsory labor systems beyond slavery—corvée was the default labor mobilization for public works. Pyramids, Great Wall, roads, canals: the great infrastructure of pre-modern states was built by obligated labor. Its persistence reveals weak labor markets; its scale reveals state capacity. Understanding corvée illuminates the relationship between states, labor, and development.

## Egyptian Corvée

### Building the Pyramids

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| System | Seasonal labor obligation |
| Timing | After harvest, during flood |
| Duration | Several months per year |
| Organization | Village quotas |
| Compensation | Food rations provided |

### Recent Evidence

| Finding | Implication |
|---------|-------------|
| Workers' village | Organized, fed workforce |
| Graffiti | Work gang identities |
| Medical care | Bones show treatment |
| Burial | Some workers buried near pyramids |
| Not slaves | Rotating, compensated labor |

### Canal and Temple Maintenance

| Project | Corvée Role |
|---------|-------------|
| Irrigation canals | Annual clearing |
| Temple construction | Seasonal labor |
| Mining expeditions | Temporary mobilization |
| Agricultural work | Royal estates |

### Economic Logic

| Factor | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| Seasonal surplus | Labor available after harvest |
| Flood period | Couldn't farm anyway |
| State capacity | Could mobilize, organize |
| No wages | No money economy |
| Taxation | Labor was the tax |

## Chinese Labor Service

### Imperial Projects

| Project | Labor System |
|---------|--------------|
| Great Wall | Massive corvée + convicts |
| Grand Canal | Millions of workers |
| Imperial palaces | Conscripted craftsmen |
| Roads | Local corvée |

### Qin-Han Organization

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Obligation | One month per year (typical) |
| Commutation | Payment in lieu (later) |
| Exemptions | Officials, aged, certain classes |
| Enforcement | Severe penalties |
| Records | Detailed registers |

### Great Wall Construction

| Aspect | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| Deaths | High mortality |
| Conditions | Brutal, remote |
| Duration | Centuries of construction |
| Labor | Soldiers, corvée, convicts |
| Legend | "Every stone cost a life" |

### Grand Canal

| Achievement | Cost |
|-------------|------|
| 1,800 km | Millions of workers |
| Integration | Connected north-south |
| Commerce | Trade flourished |
| Human cost | Mass mortality |
| Legacy | Still used today |

## Roman Labor

### Road Building

| System | Features |
|--------|----------|
| Military | Soldiers built roads |
| Corvée | Local populations |
| Slaves | Mining, quarrying |
| Contractors | Some construction |

### Mining

| Labor | Conditions |
|-------|------------|
| Slaves | Majority in mines |
| Convicts | Damnatio ad metalla |
| Free | Some skilled |
| Mortality | Extremely high |

### Urban Works

| Type | Labor |
|------|-------|
| Aqueducts | Mixed labor |
| Public buildings | Slaves, free |
| Roads | Military, corvée |
| Harbors | Slaves, contractors |

## Medieval Corvée

### Manorial Obligations

| Obligation | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| Week work | Days per week on lord's demesne |
| Boon work | Extra days at harvest |
| Carrying services | Transport duties |
| Maintenance | Roads, bridges |

### Evolution

| Period | Trend |
|--------|-------|
| Early medieval | Labor services dominant |
| High medieval | Partial commutation to rent |
| Late medieval | Money rents replace labor |
| Regional | Varied greatly |

### Why Commutation?

| Factor | Mechanism |
|--------|-----------|
| Money economy | Cash more useful |
| Supervision costs | Hard to make serfs work |
| Specialization | Hired labor more skilled |
| Population | More workers available |

## Colonial Corvée

### Mita and Repartimiento

| System | Region |
|--------|--------|
| Mita | Andean mining |
| Repartimiento | General Spanish America |
| Cuatequil | New Spain construction |

### How It Worked

| Element | Practice |
|---------|----------|
| Quota | Villages assigned numbers |
| Rotation | Periodic obligation |
| Wages | Nominal, far below market |
| Duration | Weeks or months |
| Projects | Mining, public works, church |

### Distinctive Features

| Comparison | Colonial | Ancient |
|------------|----------|---------|
| Wages | Nominal | Rations |
| Distance | Often far | Usually local |
| Mortality | Very high | Variable |
| Duration | Centuries | Centuries |
| Coexistence | With slavery | Usually dominant |

### Why Colonial Corvée?

| Factor | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| Indigenous population | Available labor |
| Mining | Required workers |
| Church | "Civilizing" justification |
| State weakness | Couldn't pay wages |

## Comparative Analysis

### When States Used Corvée

| Condition | Corvée Chosen |
|-----------|---------------|
| Weak money economy | Can't pay wages |
| State capacity | Can mobilize, organize |
| Seasonal surplus | Workers available |
| No labor market | Can't hire |
| Large projects | Need mass labor |

### Alternatives to Corvée

| Alternative | When Used |
|-------------|-----------|
| Slavery | When available, permanent needs |
| Wage labor | Market economy, skilled work |
| Contractors | Commercial construction |
| Military | Soldiers as labor |

### Efficiency

| Dimension | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Quality | Low (unmotivated workers) |
| Innovation | None (no incentive) |
| Supervision | High cost |
| Scale | Can mobilize many |
| Speed | Variable |

## Decline of Corvée

### Why It Faded

| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Monetization | Could pay wages |
| Labor markets | Workers available |
| Rights | Opposition grew |
| Efficiency | Paid labor better |
| State capacity | Could tax, hire |

### Persistence

| Form | Where |
|------|-------|
| Colonial | Until 20th century |
| Military conscription | Continues |
| Community service | Some countries |
| Prison labor | Widespread |

## The Deeper Point

Corvée was the default labor mobilization for public works—its persistence reveals weak labor markets, its scale reveals [[State Capacity|state capacity]]. [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian pyramids]], [[Ancient China|Chinese walls]], [[Roman Empire|Roman roads]]: the monuments of pre-modern states were built by obligated labor. This wasn't inefficient by design—it was rational where money economies were limited, labor markets nonexistent, and states could organize mass mobilization. The transition away from corvée required the emergence of labor markets (workers could be hired), monetization (states could pay), and rights (workers could refuse). [[Colonial Extraction Mechanisms|Colonial systems]] persisted longer because colonizers had power without accountability, using corvée alongside slavery and forced labor. The modern persistence in prison labor and military conscription shows that obligation labor never fully disappeared—states still claim labor from citizens under certain conditions. [[Institutions and Progress|Understanding corvée]] reveals that free labor markets are not natural but institutional achievements, requiring specific conditions that much of history lacked.
