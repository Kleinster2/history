# Textile History

Textiles—woven fabrics for clothing, furnishing, and other uses—have been central to economies throughout history. Textile production drove early industrialization; textile trade connected continents; textile work employed millions, often women. From ancient silk to British cottons to modern synthetics, textile history illuminates manufacturing development, trade patterns, and labor conditions.
