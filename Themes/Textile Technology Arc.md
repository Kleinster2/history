# Textile Technology Arc

Textiles were the first industrial sector—and show the complete arc of technological transformation: from handcraft to mechanization to global migration of production. The spinning jenny, water frame, and power loom destroyed millennia of craft practice. Cotton mills pioneered the factory system. The industry then migrated: Britain → New England → Japan → East Asia → Bangladesh. Textiles reveal both the power of technological change and its human costs—[[Artisanal Economy|artisan]] livelihoods destroyed, new forms of labor discipline imposed, production forever mobile.

## Overview

| Era | Technology |
|-----|------------|
| Ancient-1750 | Hand spinning, hand weaving |
| 1764-1800 | Mechanized spinning |
| 1785-1850 | Power looms |
| 1850-1950 | Global spread |
| 1950-present | Continuous migration |

## Handcraft Production

### Spinning

| Feature | Character |
|---------|-----------|
| Technology | Spindle, spinning wheel |
| Workers | Almost all women |
| Location | Home-based |
| Productivity | Very low |
| Bottleneck | Limited weaving |

### Weaving

| Feature | Character |
|---------|-----------|
| Technology | Hand loom |
| Workers | Mostly men |
| Skill | Considerable |
| Location | Home or workshop |
| Status | [[Artisanal Economy|Artisan]] |

### The Bottleneck

| Problem | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| Spinning slow | 4-8 spinners per weaver |
| Constraint | Weavers waited for yarn |
| Incentive | Mechanize spinning first |

## Mechanization

### Spinning Machines

| Invention | Date | Inventor |
|-----------|------|----------|
| Spinning jenny | 1764 | Hargreaves |
| Water frame | 1769 | Arkwright |
| Spinning mule | 1779 | Crompton |

### What They Did

| Machine | Character |
|---------|-----------|
| Jenny | Multiple spindles, home use |
| Water frame | Factory, continuous |
| Mule | Combined advantages, highest quality |

### Power Looms

| Development | Date |
|-------------|------|
| Cartwright's power loom | 1785 |
| Practical power looms | 1800s+ |
| Dominance | By 1850 |

### Productivity Gains

| Measure | Change |
|---------|--------|
| Spinning output | 100x+ increase per worker |
| Weaving output | 40x+ increase per worker |
| Cost of cloth | Fell dramatically |
| Production | Rose exponentially |

## The Factory System

### What Changed

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| Home-based | Factory |
| Task-based time | Clock discipline |
| Artisan control | Manager control |
| Family production | Wage labor |

### Cotton Mills

| Feature | Character |
|---------|-----------|
| Location | Water power, then steam |
| Workers | Women, children, men |
| Hours | 12-16 per day |
| Discipline | Strict, fines, punishment |

### Labor

| Worker type | Role |
|-------------|------|
| Women | Spinning, some weaving |
| Children | Piecing, cleaning |
| Men | Mule spinning, oversight |
| Conditions | Often harsh |

## Human Costs

### Handloom Weavers

| Period | Trajectory |
|--------|------------|
| 1760-1800 | Golden age (spinning cheap) |
| 1800-1840 | Competition from power looms |
| 1840+ | Destruction of trade |
| Outcome | Poverty, displacement |

### [[Artisanal Economy|Artisan]] Destruction

| Loss | Character |
|------|-----------|
| Skills | Obsolete |
| Independence | Became wage workers |
| Status | Degraded |
| Community | Disrupted |

### Resistance

| Movement | Character |
|----------|-----------|
| Luddites | Machine breaking |
| Unions | Some organizing |
| Outcome | Generally suppressed |

## Global Migration

### The Pattern

| Period | Center |
|--------|--------|
| 1780-1860 | Britain |
| 1860-1920 | New England, Europe |
| 1920-1980 | Japan, then Asia |
| 1980-present | Bangladesh, Vietnam, etc. |

### Why Migration?

| Factor | Mechanism |
|--------|-----------|
| Wages | Lower-wage countries |
| Technology | Easily transferred |
| Tariffs | Protected local industry |
| Skills | Quickly learned |

### Indian Deindustrialization

| Before | After British |
|--------|---------------|
| World's largest producer | De-industrialized |
| Exports | Imports |
| Weavers | Impoverished |
| Cause | Forced trade, machine competition |

## Modern Industry

### Fast Fashion

| Feature | Character |
|---------|-----------|
| Speed | Design to store in weeks |
| Cost | Very low |
| Labor | Often exploitative |
| Environment | Wasteful |

### Global Supply Chains

| Stage | Location |
|-------|----------|
| Cotton | Various |
| Spinning | Variable |
| Weaving | Low-wage countries |
| Assembly | Lowest-wage countries |
| Retail | Developed markets |

### Labor Conditions

| Issue | Reality |
|-------|---------|
| Wages | Often very low |
| Safety | Variable (Rana Plaza 2013) |
| Hours | Often long |
| Unions | Often suppressed |

## The Deeper Point

Textiles show the complete arc of [[Industrial Revolution|industrial transformation]]—from craft to factory to global migration—and its enduring tensions. The [[Innovation Economics|technological breakthrough]] (mechanized spinning) destroyed millennia of craft practice in decades. Women who had spun at home for generations found their skills worthless. Handloom weavers—briefly prosperous when cheap machine yarn was abundant—were destroyed when power looms arrived. The factory system that replaced home production imposed new discipline: clock time, overseer control, child labor. But productivity gains were real: cloth became cheap enough for ordinary people to own multiple garments. The industry then migrated—wherever wages rose, production moved on. Britain to New England to Japan to South Korea to Bangladesh to Vietnam. This mobility is the industry's defining feature: textiles are the first sector new industrializers enter and the first established producers lose. The pattern reveals both [[Institutions and Progress|progress]]—cheap cloth, mass consumption—and persistent exploitation. The Rana Plaza collapse in 2013 echoed factory fires in 1911 New York and 1860s Manchester. Technology changes; the search for cheap labor continues.
