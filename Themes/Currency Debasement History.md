# Currency Debasement History

When and why did states destroy their money? Currency debasement reveals state capacity limits—when states couldn't tax, they inflated, destroying the monetary infrastructure commerce required. From Roman denarius to medieval silver pennies to Spanish silver, the pattern repeats: fiscal pressure leads to debasement, debasement undermines confidence, and economies suffer until monetary order is restored.

## Roman Debasement

### The Denarius Trajectory

| Period | Silver Content | Context |
|--------|---------------|---------|
| Republic | 97% | Stable |
| Nero (54-68 CE) | 93% | First significant reduction |
| Septimius Severus (193-211) | 50% | Military costs |
| Caracalla (211-217) | Antoninianus introduced | Pretended to be double |
| Mid-3rd century | ~5% | Crisis |
| Diocletian (284-305) | Reform attempt | New coinage |

### Why Rome Debased

| Pressure | Response |
|----------|----------|
| Military costs | Pay soldiers with more coins |
| Fiscal limits | Couldn't raise taxes |
| Civil wars | Competing emperors needed coin |
| Inflation spiral | Each debasement required more |

### Consequences

| Effect | Outcome |
|--------|---------|
| Price increases | Inflation throughout empire |
| Hoarding | Good coins disappeared |
| Barter | Money economy declined |
| Wage/price controls | Diocletian's Edict of Maximum Prices (301) |
| Tax in kind | Return to grain payments |

### Diocletian's Crisis

| Problem | Solution Attempted |
|---------|--------------------|
| Worthless coinage | New pure coins |
| Inflation | Price controls |
| Tax collection | In-kind collection |
| Administration | Bureaucratic expansion |
| Outcome | Partial stabilization |

## Medieval Debasements

### French Manipulations

| Monarch | Action |
|---------|--------|
| Philip IV (1285-1314) | Repeated debasements for war |
| Hundred Years' War | Continuous manipulation |
| Charles VII | Stabilization attempt |
| Louis XI | Reformed coinage |

### Pattern

| Phase | Process |
|-------|---------|
| War costs | Revenue insufficient |
| Debasement | Reduce metal content |
| Profit | Seigniorage to crown |
| Inflation | Prices rise |
| Resistance | Merchants, cities object |
| Reform | Return to good money |
| Repeat | Next war, next debasement |

### English Stability (Mostly)

| Period | Policy |
|--------|--------|
| Medieval | Relatively stable pound sterling |
| Henry VIII (1544-51) | "Great Debasement" |
| Elizabeth I (1560) | Restored currency |
| Long-term | More stable than France |

### Why England Differed

| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Parliament | Consent requirement limited abuse |
| Island | Easier to control circulation |
| Wool trade | Commerce demanded reliable money |
| Reputation | Sterling valuable for trade |

## Spanish Silver

### Price Revolution

| Development | Effect |
|-------------|--------|
| American silver | Massive inflow (1540s-1640s) |
| Inflation | Prices rose across Europe |
| Spanish costs | Wages rose, competitiveness fell |
| Spreading | Silver flowed to cheaper regions |

### Not Debasement But...

| Issue | Consequence |
|-------|-------------|
| Excess supply | Too much money |
| Relative prices | Spain expensive vs. rivals |
| Dutch paradox | Silver flowed out, Dutch prospered |
| Economic decline | Spain's "resource curse" |

### Vellón Crisis

| Period | Problem |
|--------|---------|
| Philip III (1598-1621) | Copper coinage expanded |
| Philip IV (1621-1665) | Repeated vellón inflation |
| Chaos | Multiple coinages, confusion |
| Reform attempts | Repeatedly failed |
| Legacy | Spanish monetary instability |

## Comparative Analysis

### Why States Debase

| Reason | Mechanism |
|--------|-----------|
| War costs | Can't raise taxes fast enough |
| Fiscal incapacity | Administration too weak |
| Short-term thinking | Immediate revenue vs. long-term damage |
| No alternative | Debt markets undeveloped |

### Who Didn't Debase (As Much)

| State | Reason |
|-------|--------|
| Venice | Commercial interest in stable money |
| Netherlands | Merchant dominance |
| England (mostly) | Parliamentary oversight |
| Chinese copper | Different monetary system |

### Consequences Pattern

| Stage | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| Initial | Seigniorage profit |
| Medium-term | Inflation, price confusion |
| Long-term | Commerce disrupted, hoarding |
| Final | Reform required, costly |

## Lessons and Persistence

### What History Shows

| Lesson | Evidence |
|--------|----------|
| Temptation constant | Repeated across civilizations |
| Costs real | Economic disruption, lost trust |
| Reform possible | But politically difficult |
| Institutions matter | Constraints prevent abuse |

### Institutional Solutions

| Solution | Example |
|----------|---------|
| Independent mints | Limited political control |
| Parliamentary oversight | English model |
| Commercial interests | Merchant-dominated states |
| Multiple currencies | Competition among monies |
| Gold standard | 19th century constraint |

### Modern Echoes

| Ancient/Medieval | Modern Parallel |
|------------------|-----------------|
| Debasement | Inflation via money printing |
| Fiscal pressure | Deficit monetization |
| Loss of confidence | Currency crises |
| Reform | Central bank independence |

## The Deeper Point

Currency debasement reveals [[State Capacity|state capacity]] limits—when states couldn't tax, they inflated, destroying the monetary infrastructure commerce required. [[Roman Empire|Roman]] debasement accompanied the third-century crisis; French medieval kings debased whenever wars exhausted treasuries; [[Spanish Empire Economy|Spanish]] vellón inflation disrupted Iberian commerce. The pattern reveals a fundamental fiscal choice: states can extract through taxation (requires administrative capacity), borrowing (requires creditworthiness), or inflation (destroys the monetary system). Where states had fiscal capacity—effective taxation, credible debt—they avoided debasement. Where they lacked capacity, they debased, and commerce suffered. [[Money|Monetary stability]] is itself an institution requiring constant maintenance. The [[Institutions and Progress|institutional innovation]] of independent central banks, developed over centuries, addresses the ancient problem: how to prevent states from destroying their own money. Modern inflation is the descendant of ancient debasement—fiscal pressure finding monetary expression. The lesson history teaches is that [[Financial Crises|monetary disorder]] ultimately requires fiscal solutions.
