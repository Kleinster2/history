# Mancur Olson

Mancur Olson asked a question that seems obvious once posed: if a group shares common interests, why don't they automatically act together to pursue them? His answer—the **logic of collective action**—revealed why large groups often fail to organize while small groups succeed, why democracies accumulate rent-seeking lobbies, and why some societies stagnate while others grow. Olson's insights connect to everything from union formation to trade policy to why the Roman Empire fell.

## Overview

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Life | 1932-1998 |
| Field | Economics, political science |
| Key works | *The Logic of Collective Action* (1965), *The Rise and Decline of Nations* (1982) |
| Core insight | Groups with shared interests often fail to act collectively |
| Influence | Public choice theory, interest group politics, development |

## The Logic of Collective Action (1965)

### The Puzzle

| Observation | Problem |
|-------------|---------|
| Workers share interests | But unions are hard to form |
| Consumers share interests | But consumer lobbies are weak |
| Diffuse groups | Rarely organize effectively |
| Why? | If the benefit is shared, why pay the cost? |

### The Free Rider Problem

| Logic | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Public goods | Benefits go to everyone in the group |
| Non-excludability | Can't exclude non-contributors |
| Rational response | Let others bear the cost |
| Result | Under-provision of collective goods |

### Small vs. Large Groups

| Small Groups | Large Groups |
|--------------|--------------|
| Individual contribution visible | Individual contribution invisible |
| Social pressure works | Anonymity protects free riders |
| Can monitor each other | Monitoring impossible |
| Organize easily | Organize with difficulty |

### Selective Incentives

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Definition | Benefits only for contributors |
| Examples | Union insurance, professional credentials |
| Function | Overcome free rider problem |
| Implication | Groups need side benefits to form |

## The Rise and Decline of Nations (1982)

### The Argument

| Claim | Logic |
|-------|-------|
| Stable societies accumulate interest groups | Time allows organization |
| Interest groups seek rents | Redistributive, not productive |
| "Distributional coalitions" | Lobbies, cartels, professional associations |
| Result | Sclerosis—growth slows |

### Why Stability Causes Stagnation

| Step | Mechanism |
|------|-----------|
| 1 | Stability allows organizing time |
| 2 | Small groups (concentrated interests) organize first |
| 3 | They seek policies favoring themselves |
| 4 | Society accumulates rent-seekers |
| 5 | Growth slows as resources go to redistribution |

### Why Disruption Causes Growth

| Pattern | Examples |
|---------|----------|
| Post-war Germany, Japan | Old coalitions destroyed |
| Post-revolution | Rent-seekers eliminated |
| New democracies | Fresh start |
| Prediction | Disrupted societies grow faster |

### Evidence

| Case | Olson's Interpretation |
|------|------------------------|
| Germany/Japan post-1945 | Defeated, coalitions destroyed → miracle growth |
| Britain post-1945 | Victorious, coalitions intact → slow growth |
| American South | Disrupted by Civil War → faster growth than North |
| Olson's puzzle | Why did Britain decline relative to Europe? |

## Key Concepts

### Distributional Coalitions

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Definition | Groups organized to redistribute toward themselves |
| Examples | Agricultural lobbies, professional licensure, trade associations |
| Effect | Resources flow to lobbying, not production |
| Cumulative | They accumulate over time in stable societies |

### Concentrated vs. Diffuse Interests

| Concentrated | Diffuse |
|--------------|---------|
| Steel producers | Steel consumers |
| Doctors | Patients |
| Sugar farmers | Candy buyers |
| Organize easily | Organize with difficulty |
| Wins politically | Loses politically |

### Encompassing vs. Narrow Organizations

| Encompassing | Narrow |
|--------------|--------|
| Covers broad group | Covers small group |
| Internalizes costs | Externalizes costs |
| Seeks growth | Seeks redistribution |
| Example: Peak union | Example: Single firm lobby |

## Applications

### Trade Policy

| Pattern | Explanation |
|---------|-------------|
| Producers seek tariffs | Concentrated, organized |
| Consumers don't fight | Diffuse, unorganized |
| Result | Protectionism despite net harm |
| Olson's insight | Politics favors organized minorities |

### Professional Licensing

| Pattern | Explanation |
|---------|-------------|
| Doctors restrict entry | Concentrated benefit |
| Patients pay more | Diffuse harm |
| Result | Licensing proliferates |
| Olson's insight | Quality arguments often mask rent-seeking |

### Agricultural Policy

| Pattern | Explanation |
|---------|-------------|
| Farmers organized | Few in number, high stakes |
| Consumers unorganized | Many, small individual stakes |
| Result | Farm subsidies persist despite inefficiency |

### Union Power

| Olson's View | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| Unions hard to form | Large group, free rider problem |
| But once formed | Can extract rents |
| Closed shop | Selective incentive (must join to work) |
| Peak unions | More encompassing, less distorting |

---

## Stationary vs. Roving Bandits

### Late Work (1990s)

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Roving bandit | Steals everything, moves on |
| Stationary bandit | Settles, extracts sustainably |
| State origin | Stationary bandit better than roving |
| Key insight | Even dictatorship can be developmental |

### Implications

| Logic | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Roving bandit | Has no interest in future |
| Stationary bandit | Wants the economy to grow (larger tax base) |
| Transition | From anarchy to autocracy is improvement |
| Further | From autocracy to democracy is another improvement |

## Critiques and Limitations

### What Olson Got Right

| Insight | Validation |
|---------|------------|
| Free rider problem | Well-documented |
| Small groups organize better | Empirically supported |
| Interest groups distort policy | Widely observed |
| Post-war growth patterns | Germany/Japan fit |

### What Critics Question

| Critique | Argument |
|----------|----------|
| Sclerosis thesis | Britain's decline has other explanations |
| Direction of causation | Maybe slow growth causes sclerosis |
| Ostrom's challenge | Groups sometimes do cooperate |
| Historical fit | Not all stable societies decline |
| Measurement | How do you measure "distributional coalitions"? |

### The Ostrom Correction

| Olson's View | Ostrom's Response |
|--------------|-------------------|
| Collective action fails | Can succeed with right institutions |
| Need selective incentives | Norms and monitoring can work |
| Top-down solutions needed | Local self-governance works |
| See | [[Institutional Economics Primer]] on Ostrom |

## Key Quotes

> "Unless the number of individuals in a group is quite small, or unless there is coercion or some other special device to make individuals act in their common interest, rational, self-interested individuals will not act to achieve their common or group interests."

> "The best-known logical explanations of how countries that had been defeated or devastated in World War II grew so remarkably fast... are fundamentally unsatisfying."

> "Stable societies with unchanged boundaries tend to accumulate more collusions and organizations for collective action over time."
