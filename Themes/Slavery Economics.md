# Slavery Economics

Slavery is the oldest form of labor exploitation—and one of the most economically significant. From Mesopotamian debt-slaves to Roman plantation agriculture to the Atlantic system that built the modern world, unfree labor was central to wealth creation for millennia. The economic question isn't moral (slavery is evil) but analytical: *why* did slavery dominate some economies and not others? When was it "efficient" and when wasn't it? Why did it end when it did? Understanding slavery economics is essential for understanding wealth accumulation, industrialization, and the foundations of the modern global economy—much of which was built on enslaved labor.

## Overview

### Forms of Unfree Labor

| Type | Character | Example |
|------|-----------|---------|
| Debt slavery | Work off obligation | [[Ancient Credit|Mesopotamia]], Greece |
| Chattel slavery | Property, hereditary | Roman, Atlantic |
| Serfdom | Bound to land | Medieval Europe, Russia |
| Corvée | Forced state labor | Egypt, Inca, colonial |
| Indentured servitude | Contract-bound, temporary | Colonial Americas |
| Convict labor | Punishment-based | Penal colonies, prison labor |

### Scale Through History

| Period | Estimated Scale |
|--------|-----------------|
| Ancient Mesopotamia | 10-30% of urban population |
| Classical Athens | 30-40% of population |
| Roman Italy (1st c. BCE) | 30-40% of population |
| Medieval Europe | Serfdom: 80%+ (not chattel slavery) |
| Atlantic trade (1500-1870) | 12.5 million transported |
| US South (1860) | 4 million enslaved |

## Ancient Slavery

### Mesopotamia

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Origin | Debt, war captives |
| Scale | Moderate (not majority of labor) |
| Status | Person with reduced rights (not pure property) |
| Manumission | Possible, even common |
| Economic role | Domestic, workshop, temple labor |
| Alternative | Free workers also available |

### Greek Slavery

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Scale | Large (30-40% in Athens) |
| Sources | War, piracy, trade, breeding |
| Uses | Mining (Laurium), domestic, craft |
| Citizen leisure | Slavery enabled political participation |
| Economic logic | Free citizens won't do degrading work |
| [[Greek Economic Thought|Aristotle's view]] | Some people "natural slaves" |

### Roman Slavery

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Scale | Massive (largest slave economy before Americas) |
| Sources | Conquest (millions captured) |
| Uses | Agriculture, mining, domestic, gladiators, craft |
| Plantation system | Latifundia—large estates, gang labor |
| Urban slaves | Skilled craft, business management |
| Peculium | Slaves could accumulate savings, buy freedom |

### Roman Plantation Economics

| Feature | Logic |
|---------|-------|
| Cheap supply | Constant wars provided slaves |
| Gang labor | Economies of scale in agriculture |
| Displaced free farmers | Couldn't compete with free labor |
| Result | Wealth concentration, urban poor |
| Decline | When conquests stopped, slaves got expensive |
| Transition | Coloni (tenant farmers) → serfdom |

## The Atlantic System (1500-1870)

### Scale

| Measure | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Africans transported | 12.5 million |
| Died in passage | 1.5-2 million (Middle Passage) |
| Destination: Brazil | 5 million |
| Destination: Caribbean | 4-5 million |
| Destination: US | ~400,000 (grew to 4 million) |
| Duration | 350+ years |

### The Triangle Trade

| Leg | Cargo | Profit |
|-----|-------|--------|
| Europe → Africa | Manufactured goods, guns | Buy slaves |
| Africa → Americas | Enslaved people | Sell slaves |
| Americas → Europe | [[Sugar Economy|Sugar]], cotton, tobacco | Sell commodities |
| Result | All three legs profitable |

### What Slave Labor Produced

| Commodity | Where | Global Significance |
|-----------|-------|---------------------|
| Sugar | Caribbean, Brazil | World's most valuable commodity (1700s) |
| Cotton | US South | Fed Industrial Revolution textiles |
| Tobacco | US South, Caribbean | Early colonial cash crop |
| Rice | Carolina, Brazil | Skilled African knowledge |
| Coffee | Brazil, Caribbean | Global stimulant market |
| Mining | Brazil (gold), Spanish America | Bullion flows |

### Profitability Debate

| View | Argument |
|------|----------|
| Highly profitable | Planters were richest people in Americas |
| Inefficient? | Fogel & Engerman: actually very efficient |
| Williams thesis | Slave profits funded Industrial Revolution |
| Counter | Industrial Revolution didn't require slave capital |
| Consensus | Profitable for owners; devastating for enslaved; contributed to but didn't solely cause industrialization |

## Why Slavery Ended

### Economic Arguments for Abolition

| Argument | Logic |
|----------|-------|
| Free labor more productive | Workers with incentives work harder |
| Slavery blocks innovation | No incentive to mechanize |
| Market development | Slaves can't be consumers |
| Capital misallocation | Wealth locked in human property |
| Industrial competition | Factory North vs. Plantation South |

### Non-Economic Factors

| Factor | Role |
|--------|------|
| Moral revolution | Enlightenment, religious movements |
| Slave resistance | Constant rebellion, escape, sabotage |
| Haitian Revolution (1791) | Slaves overthrew masters |
| British abolition (1807/1833) | Empire banned trade, then slavery |
| US Civil War (1861-65) | [[American Civil War|Industrial North defeats agricultural South]] |
| Brazil (1888) | Last major slave society abolishes |

### Was Abolition Economic or Moral?

| Position | Evidence |
|----------|----------|
| Economic | Slavery was becoming unprofitable anyway |
| Moral | Abolitionists led, economics followed |
| Both | Moral movement succeeded when economic conditions aligned |
| Williams | British abolished when slavery stopped serving British interests |
| Drescher | Slavery was still profitable; abolition was "econocide" |

## The Economic Legacy

### What Slavery Built

| Legacy | Mechanism |
|--------|-----------|
| Capital accumulation | Plantation profits → investment |
| Infrastructure | Ports, ships, insurance, banking |
| [[Cotton Economy|Cotton industry]] | Raw material for Industrial Revolution |
| Sugar industry | Global commodity, processing technology |
| Financial instruments | Slaves as collateral, slave-backed bonds |
| Racial capitalism | Structural inequality persists |

### Post-Emancipation Economies

| Region | Transition |
|--------|------------|
| US South | Sharecropping, convict leasing, Jim Crow |
| Caribbean | Indentured labor (India, China) replaced |
| Brazil | Marginalization, favelas |
| Pattern | Formal freedom, economic subordination |

## Comparative Analysis

### Why Some Economies Used Slaves, Others Didn't

| Factor | Slavery Likely | Slavery Unlikely |
|--------|---------------|-----------------|
| Land abundance | Yes (need labor for land) | No |
| Free labor scarce | Yes (no alternatives) | No |
| Export crops | Yes (plantation scale) | No |
| State power | Yes (enforce property) | No |
| Conquest | Yes (supply of captives) | No |

### Slavery vs. Other Unfree Labor

| System | Character | End |
|--------|-----------|-----|
| Slavery | Person as property | Abolition movements |
| Serfdom | Bound to land | Gradual elimination (1400s-1861) |
| Indentured | Temporary contract | Expired |
| Corvée | State labor obligation | Modern taxation replaces |
| Wage labor | "Free" but constrained | Ongoing |
