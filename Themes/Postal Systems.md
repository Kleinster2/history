# Postal Systems

From Roman imperial dispatch to overnight delivery. Postal systems were the information infrastructure that enabled commerce, governance, and finance before electricity. Who controlled the post—and who could afford it—shaped economic development for millennia.

## Ancient Post

## The Deeper Point

Postal systems were [[Institutions and Progress|institutional infrastructure]] that determined who could communicate and at what cost. Ancient posts served states; medieval posts served churches and merchants who could afford private networks; national posts eventually democratized access.

The 1840 Penny Post was an institutional revolution. Uniform pricing and prepayment lowered [[Information Costs in History|transaction costs]] and enabled mass participation. Letters per capita exploded. The working class could maintain family ties across distances. Businesses could coordinate at unprecedented scale.

But postal systems also shaped economic geography. Where posts went, commerce followed. The US constitutional mandate for post offices was recognition that information infrastructure shapes development. The [[Thurn und Taxis]] network connecting European commercial centers enabled the emerging capitalist economy. Routes that excluded regions left them economically isolated.

The postal system's decline—replaced by telegraph, telephone, and internet—shows how infrastructure evolves. Each technology lowered information costs further, enabling new economic arrangements. But the institutional pattern persists: who controls information infrastructure, who can access it, and at what price remain questions that shape economic development.
