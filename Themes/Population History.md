# Population History

Population—the number of people and their characteristics—fundamentally shapes economies. From the agricultural revolution's growth to the Black Death's collapse to the modern demographic transition, population changes have driven economic development, labor supply, and resource pressure. Demographic history illuminates how births, deaths, and migration interact with economic forces.

## Overview

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Scope | Human numbers through time |
| Forces | Birth, death, migration |
| Economic link | Labor, demand, resources |
| Pattern | Growth with crises |
| Modern | Demographic transition |

## Long-Term Trends

### Prehistory

| Period | Estimate |
|--------|----------|
| 10,000 BCE | ~5-10 million |
| Agriculture begins | Growth enabling |
| 1 CE | ~250-300 million |
| Growth rate | Very slow |

### Historical

| Period | World Population |
|--------|------------------|
| 1 CE | ~300 million |
| 1000 CE | ~300 million |
| 1500 | ~450 million |
| 1800 | ~1 billion |
| 1900 | ~1.6 billion |
| 2000 | ~6 billion |
| 2024 | ~8 billion |

## Malthusian Theory

### Core Ideas

| Concept | Content |
|---------|---------|
| Growth potential | Geometric |
| Food production | Arithmetic |
| Checks | Preventive, positive |
| Equilibrium | Subsistence level |

### Preventive Checks

| Check | Mechanism |
|-------|-----------|
| Late marriage | Delayed fertility |
| Celibacy | Non-marriage |
| Abstinence | Within marriage |
| Effect | Reduced births |

### Positive Checks

| Check | Mechanism |
|-------|-----------|
| Famine | Food shortage |
| Disease | Epidemics |
| War | Conflict mortality |
| Effect | Increased deaths |

## Major Population Events

### Agricultural Revolution

| Effect | Character |
|--------|-----------|
| Carrying capacity | Increased |
| Settlement | Enabled |
| Growth | Gradual acceleration |
| New regime | Agricultural demography |

### Urban Growth

| Period | Character |
|--------|-----------|
| Ancient cities | Mortality sinks |
| Medieval | Limited urbanization |
| Modern | Massive growth |
| Effect | Different patterns |

### Black Death

| Feature | Character |
|---------|-----------|
| Date | 1347-1351 |
| Mortality | 30-60% Europe |
| Economic effect | Labor scarcity |
| Recovery | Centuries |

### Columbian Exchange

| Effect | Scale |
|--------|-------|
| Americas collapse | 90% in some areas |
| Causes | Disease, conquest |
| Recovery | Centuries |
| Old World | Population growth |

### 19th-20th Century Growth

| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Mortality decline | Earlier |
| Fertility decline | Later |
| Gap | Population explosion |
| Scale | Unprecedented |

## Demographic Transition

### Model

| Stage | Character |
|-------|-----------|
| 1. Pre-transition | High birth, high death |
| 2. Early | Death declining, high birth |
| 3. Late | Birth declining |
| 4. Post-transition | Low birth, low death |

### Causes of Mortality Decline

| Factor | Timing |
|--------|--------|
| Nutrition | 18th century onward |
| Public health | 19th century |
| Medicine | 20th century |
| Knowledge | Gradual spread |

### Causes of Fertility Decline

| Factor | Mechanism |
|--------|-----------|
| Child survival | Less replacement needed |
| Education | Especially female |
| Urbanization | Children costly |
| Contraception | Means available |

## Economic Implications

### Labor Supply

| Effect | Mechanism |
|--------|-----------|
| Population growth | More workers |
| Age structure | Dependency ratios |
| Migration | Reallocation |
| Human capital | Quality vs. quantity |

### Demand

| Effect | Mechanism |
|--------|-----------|
| Markets | Population creates |
| Investment | Demand driven |
| Consumption | Population-based |

### Resources

| Question | Debate |
|----------|--------|
| Malthusian limits | Resource constraints |
| Technology | Overcomes limits? |
| Sustainability | Modern concern |
| Climate | Population impact |

## Regional Patterns

### Europe

| Period | Character |
|--------|-----------|
| Pre-modern | Slow growth, crises |
| 19th century | Rapid growth |
| 20th century | Transition complete |
| Today | Aging, low growth |

### Asia

| Region | Pattern |
|--------|---------|
| China | Largest, controlled |
| India | Growth continuing |
| East Asia | Transition advanced |
| Southeast Asia | Variable |

### Africa

| Pattern | Character |
|---------|-----------|
| Historical | Slave trade impact |
| Modern | Rapid growth |
| Transition | Incomplete |
| Youth | Large populations |
