# Entrepreneurship

The entrepreneur—someone who sees an opportunity, takes a risk, and creates something new—is capitalism's central character. But the role didn't always exist. In most societies through most of history, commerce was low-status, risk was irrational, and innovation was suspect. The emergence of entrepreneurship as a legitimate, even celebrated, social role required specific cultural, legal, and institutional conditions. Understanding when and where entrepreneurs flourished—and why some societies produced them while others didn't—is central to explaining the [[Great Divergence]] and the origins of modern business.

## Overview

### The Puzzle

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| Are entrepreneurs born or made? | Mostly made (by institutions) |
| Why some places, not others? | Culture + law + markets + capital |
| Is it just risk-taking? | No—also vision, organization, execution |
| Schumpeter's definition | "Creative destruction"—new combinations |
| Modern debate | Can entrepreneurship be taught? |

### Timeline

| Era | Entrepreneurial Character |
|-----|---------------------------|
| Ancient | Merchants (low status, tolerated) |
| Medieval | Traders, bankers (rising status) |
| Early Modern | Merchant-capitalists, projectors |
| Industrial | Factory owners, inventors |
| Gilded Age | "Robber barons" / titans |
| 20th century | Corporate entrepreneurs, franchise |
| Late 20th century | Silicon Valley, startup culture |

## The Deeper Point

Baumol's 1990 thesis—the vault's central insight—is that the supply of entrepreneurial talent is roughly constant across societies and eras; what varies is the direction [[Institutions and Progress|institutions]] channel it. Roman entrepreneurs captured slaves and tax-farming contracts; medieval Venetians built trade networks and crusade financing; [[Gilded Age]] Americans built railroads *and* political machines simultaneously. The entrepreneur isn't inherently productive or destructive—they're responsive to the incentive structure. This reframes [[Development Economics|development]]: the question isn't "how do we create entrepreneurs?" (they exist everywhere, from Lagos market traders to Shenzhen factory founders) but "how do we make productive [[Innovation Economics|entrepreneurship]] more rewarding than predatory, rent-seeking, or criminal entrepreneurship?" The answer is always institutional: [[Property Rights|property rights]] that protect investment, legal systems that enforce contracts, entry barriers low enough to permit competition, and financial systems that fund startups over incumbents. Silicon Valley didn't produce more talented people than Soviet Russia—it produced an institutional environment where talent flowed into garages and code rather than into bureaucracy and black markets.
