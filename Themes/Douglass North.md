# Douglass North

Douglass North transformed how economists think about history and institutions. Before North, economic history was largely about measuring—GDP, prices, trade volumes. North asked *why*: why did some economies develop institutions that enabled growth while others didn't? His answer—that institutions determine transaction costs, which determine economic performance—became foundational to development economics, political economy, and this vault's approach to history.

## Overview

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Life | 1920-2015 |
| Field | Economic history, institutional economics |
| Nobel Prize | 1993 (with Robert Fogel) |
| Key work | *Institutions, Institutional Change and Economic Performance* (1990) |
| Core insight | Institutions are the "rules of the game" that shape economic outcomes |

## Key Concepts

### Institutions Defined

| Type | Description | Examples |
|------|-------------|----------|
| Formal | Written rules | Constitutions, laws, property rights |
| Informal | Unwritten norms | Customs, traditions, codes of conduct |
| Enforcement | Mechanisms ensuring compliance | Courts, police, social sanctions |

North's definition: "Institutions are the humanly devised constraints that structure political, economic and social interaction."

### Transaction Costs

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Definition | Costs of using the market |
| Types | Search, bargaining, enforcement, measurement |
| Key insight | Institutions determine transaction costs |
| Implication | High transaction costs → less exchange → less growth |

### The Framework

| Step | Logic |
|------|-------|
| 1 | Economies are built on exchange |
| 2 | Exchange has costs (transaction costs) |
| 3 | Institutions determine transaction costs |
| 4 | Therefore, institutions determine economic performance |

## Major Works

### *The Rise of the Western World* (1973, with Robert Thomas)

| Argument | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Question | Why did the West grow rich first? |
| Answer | Property rights that aligned private and social returns |
| Mechanism | When people capture gains from innovation, they innovate |
| Example | England vs. Spain—different property rights, different outcomes |

### *Structure and Change in Economic History* (1981)

| Contribution | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| State theory | States trade protection for revenue |
| Ideology | Belief systems affect institutions |
| Path dependence | History matters—past shapes present |

### *Institutions, Institutional Change and Economic Performance* (1990)

| Contribution | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| Synthesis | Comprehensive institutional framework |
| Key concept | Institutions as "rules of the game" |
| Organizations | "Players" who operate within rules |
| Change | Incremental, path-dependent, rarely revolutionary |
| Nobel foundation | This book anchored the prize |

### *Violence and Social Orders* (2009, with Wallis & Weingast)

| Contribution | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| Two orders | Limited access vs. open access |
| Key insight | Most societies control violence through rent distribution |
| Transition | From limited to open access is rare, fragile |
| See | [[Violence and Social Orders]] |

## The Institutional Framework

### Institutions vs. Organizations

| Category | Definition | Examples |
|----------|------------|----------|
| Institutions | Rules of the game | Property law, contract law, constitution |
| Organizations | Players of the game | Firms, churches, governments, unions |
| Relationship | Organizations operate within and try to change institutions |

### Why Institutions Are Sticky

| Factor | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Increasing returns | Institutions create complementary institutions |
| Learning effects | People adapt to existing rules |
| Network effects | Coordination around existing norms |
| Political lock-in | Beneficiaries defend current arrangements |
| Result | Path dependence—history constrains future |

### Institutional Change

| Type | Mechanism |
|------|-----------|
| Incremental | Marginal adjustments to rules |
| Discontinuous | Revolution, conquest, crisis |
| Driver | Organizations seeking advantage push against constraints |
| Rate | Usually slow; informal norms change slowest |

## Historical Applications

### Medieval Trade Revival

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Long-distance trade risky | Merchant guilds, reputation systems |
| Contract enforcement absent | Champagne fairs, lex mercatoria |
| Monitoring impossible | Maghribi traders' coalition |
| Implication | Informal institutions enabled medieval commerce |

### England vs. Spain

| England | Spain |
|---------|-------|
| Parliament constrained crown | Absolutist monarchy |
| Property rights secure | Crown could seize property |
| Merchants invested | Merchants hid wealth |
| Innovation rewarded | Innovation pointless if seized |
| Outcome: Growth | Outcome: Stagnation despite silver |

### Why Not China?

| Factor | North's View |
|--------|--------------|
| Bureaucratic empire | No institutional competition |
| Property not secure | Emperor could redistribute |
| No Parliament equivalent | No constraint on rulers |
| Result | Brilliant but static |

## Critiques and Debates

### What North Got Right

| Claim | Support |
|-------|---------|
| Institutions matter | Overwhelming empirical evidence |
| Property rights central | Investment requires security |
| Transaction costs real | Explains why some economies develop |
| Path dependence | Colonial institutions persist |

### What Critics Question

| Critique | Argument |
|----------|----------|
| Functionalism | Did institutions develop *because* efficient, or for other reasons? |
| Eurocentrism | Measuring other societies against Western institutions |
| Chicken and egg | Do institutions cause growth or does growth enable institutions? |
| Too abstract | Which specific institutions matter most? |
| Culture neglected | Informal norms may be more important than formal rules |

### The Endogeneity Problem

| Issue | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Correlation | Good institutions correlate with wealth |
| Causation | But does wealth enable good institutions? |
| Solution attempts | Natural experiments (colonial origins) |
| North's response | History shows institutions came first |

## Key Quotes

> "Institutions are the rules of the game in a society or, more formally, are the humanly devised constraints that shape human interaction."

> "The inability of societies to develop effective, low-cost enforcement of contracts is the most important source of both historical stagnation and contemporary underdevelopment."

> "History matters. It matters not just because we can learn from the past, but because the present and the future are connected to the past by the continuity of a society's institutions."
