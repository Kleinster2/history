# Austrian Economics

The alternative tradition emphasizing spontaneous order. Austrian economics sees institutions as emergent rather than designed—markets as discovery processes rather than equilibrium machines.

## Origins

### The Austrian School

| Generation | Key Figures |
|------------|-------------|
| Founders (1870s-1920s) | Carl Menger, Eugen von Böhm-Bawerk, Friedrich von Wieser |
| Interwar (1920s-1940s) | Ludwig von Mises, Friedrich Hayek |
| Post-war | Murray Rothbard, Israel Kirzner |
| Contemporary | Various think tanks and academics |

### Vienna Context

| Factor | Influence |
|--------|-----------|
| Marginalist revolution | Menger as co-founder |
| Habsburg Empire | Multilingual, multicultural |
| Socialist challenge | Vienna "Red" period |
| Emigration | 1930s-40s dispersal to UK, US |

## Core Ideas

### Subjective Value Theory

| Classical View | Austrian View |
|----------------|---------------|
| Labor theory of value | Subjective utility |
| Objective worth | Value in the eye of the beholder |
| Cost determines price | Price determines what costs are worth bearing |

### Methodological Individualism

| Principle | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| Only individuals act | Collectives don't choose |
| Intentions matter | Purposeful human action |
| Praxeology | Logic of action |
| Deduction | From action axiom |

### The Knowledge Problem

| Hayek's Insight | Implication |
|-----------------|-------------|
| Knowledge is dispersed | No central planner can know it all |
| Local knowledge | Specific to time and place |
| Tacit knowledge | Can't be articulated |
| Price signals | Communicate dispersed information |

## The Socialist Calculation Debate

### Mises's Challenge (1920)

| Argument | Consequence |
|----------|-------------|
| Without private property | No market prices |
| Without prices | No economic calculation |
| Without calculation | No rational resource allocation |
| Conclusion | Socialism is impossible |

### Socialist Responses

| Response | Austrian Counter |
|----------|------------------|
| Lange (market socialism) | Still lacks real prices |
| Computation | Can't centralize local knowledge |
| Incentives | Bureaucrats don't face consequences |

### Historical Vindication

| Evidence | Interpretation |
|----------|----------------|
| Soviet collapse | Calculation problem confirmed |
| Shortages and surpluses | Price distortion effects |
| Quality problems | No consumer feedback |
| Innovation failure | No entrepreneurial discovery |

## Business Cycle Theory

### Austrian Theory of the Cycle

| Stage | Mechanism |
|-------|-----------|
| Credit expansion | Central bank lowers rates |
| Malinvestment | Investment in wrong projects |
| Boom | Artificial prosperity |
| Bust | Malinvestments revealed |
| Recession | Necessary correction |

### Versus Keynesian View

| Austrian | Keynesian |
|----------|-----------|
| Bust is correction | Bust is market failure |
| Don't intervene | Stimulate demand |
| Let prices adjust | Sticky prices prevent adjustment |
| Credit expansion caused it | Animal spirits |

### Policy Implications

| Austrian Recommendation | Rationale |
|-------------------------|-----------|
| Sound money | Prevent artificial credit |
| Let recessions run | Correct malinvestments |
| No bailouts | Moral hazard |
| Minimal intervention | Markets self-correct |

## Spontaneous Order

### Hayek's Framework

| Concept | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| Spontaneous order | Emerges without design |
| Cosmos vs. taxis | Grown vs. made orders |
| Evolution | Institutions evolve, not designed |
| Unintended consequences | Planned orders fail |

### Examples of Spontaneous Order

| Institution | Emergence |
|-------------|-----------|
| Money | From barter, not government decree |
| Language | Evolved, not designed |
| Common law | Case-by-case development |
| Market prices | No one sets them |

### Versus Constructivist Rationalism

| Constructivism | Hayek's Critique |
|----------------|------------------|
| Design institutions rationally | Fatal conceit |
| Plan the economy | Knowledge problem |
| Engineer society | Unintended consequences |
| Top-down | Bottom-up emergence |

## Entrepreneurship

### Kirzner's Theory

| Concept | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| Alertness | Noticing opportunities |
| Discovery | Finding what others missed |
| Arbitrage | Buying low, selling high |
| Coordination | Moving toward equilibrium |

### Versus Schumpeter

| Kirzner | Schumpeter |
|---------|------------|
| Equilibrating | Disequilibrating |
| Discovery | Creation |
| Alertness | Innovation |
| Coordination | Destruction |

## Influence and Legacy

### Policy Influence

| Area | Austrian Influence |
|------|-------------------|
| Deregulation | Skepticism of intervention |
| Privatization | Markets over government |
| Sound money | Inflation concerns |
| Free trade | Spontaneous order |

### Think Tanks

| Institution | Role |
|-------------|------|
| Mises Institute | Education, publishing |
| Cato Institute | Policy influence |
| Institute of Economic Affairs | UK free market |
| Mont Pelerin Society | International network |

## Critiques and Limits

### From Mainstream

| Critique | Austrian Response |
|----------|-------------------|
| Not empirical | Praxeology is deductive |
| No predictions | Complexity prevents prediction |
| No mathematics | Math misleads |
| Ideological | All schools have values |

### From Left

| Critique | Challenge |
|----------|-----------|
| Ignores power | Markets not neutral |
| Inequality | Spontaneous doesn't mean just |
| Market failures | Externalities, monopoly |
| Historical | Markets required state |

### Internal Tensions

| Issue | Debate |
|-------|--------|
| Anarcho-capitalism vs. minarchism | How minimal is minimal? |
| Gold standard vs. free banking | What's sound money? |
| Natural rights vs. utilitarianism | Philosophical foundations |

## Relationship to Institutional Economics

### Common Ground

| Shared | Emphasis |
|--------|----------|
| Institutions matter | Rules shape behavior |
| History matters | Path dependence |
| Knowledge dispersed | Local information |
| Emergence | Not all designed |

### Differences

| Austrian | Institutional |
|----------|---------------|
| Markets naturally emerge | Markets require institutions |
| State mostly harmful | State can enable |
| Minimal intervention | Context-dependent |
| Universal theory | Historical specificity |

## The Deeper Point

Austrian economics sees [[Institutions and Progress|institutions]] as emergent rather than designed—money arose from barter, law from custom, markets from exchange. This spontaneous order perspective offers an important corrective to the belief that all good institutions must be consciously designed. But the Austrian framework has limits: markets *require* supporting institutions (property rights, contract enforcement) that often *were* deliberately created or evolved through political struggle. The knowledge problem is real—central planners can't know what dispersed individuals know—but that insight applies to markets too: participants don't always know what they're doing, leading to [[Speculative Bubbles|bubbles]] and crashes. The Austrian tradition's most lasting contribution may be its emphasis on the *process* of markets rather than equilibrium outcomes—the discovery, coordination, and entrepreneurship that the mathematical models of [[Neoclassical Economics]] often obscure.
