# Capitalism

Capitalism—an economic system where private ownership, market exchange, and profit-seeking organize production—emerged gradually in early modern Europe and now dominates the global economy. Its origins are debated: was it born in medieval Italian cities, Dutch trading companies, or British factories? Capitalism created unprecedented wealth and inequality, transformed work and social relations, and raised persistent questions about markets, morality, and sustainability.
