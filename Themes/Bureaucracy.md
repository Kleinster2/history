# Bureaucracy

Bureaucracy—professional administration through hierarchical offices, written records, and standardized procedures—enabled complex societies to organize large populations and economies. From Chinese mandarins to modern civil services, bureaucratic administration allowed states to tax, regulate, and mobilize resources at scale. Bureaucracy is both a cause and consequence of economic development, creating capacity for public goods while generating costs and rigidities.
