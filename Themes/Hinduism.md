# Hinduism

Hinduism—India's indigenous religious tradition—is less a unified religion than a family of beliefs and practices that evolved over millennia. From Vedic sacrifices to temple worship to bhakti devotionalism, Hindu traditions shaped Indian society, economy, and politics. Temple economies controlled vast lands; caste organized labor and exchange; pilgrimage generated commerce. Understanding Hindu economic life means understanding how religion permeated all aspects of Indian civilization.
