# Apprenticeship to Education

How did skill formation institutions evolve? Societies that invested in human capital compounded the advantages. From medieval guild apprenticeship through factory training to mass education, the institutions for developing skills have transformed—but the fundamental question remains: who invests in human capital, and who benefits?

## Medieval Apprenticeship

### Guild System

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Duration | 5-7 years typical |
| Entry | Fee paid, family connection |
| Relationship | Master, journeyman, apprentice |
| Training | Hands-on, workshop |
| Outcome | Journeyman status |
| Regulation | Guild oversight |

### How It Worked

| Stage | Process |
|-------|---------|
| Entry | Family pays fee, signs contract |
| Early | Menial work, observation |
| Middle | Assistance, simple tasks |
| Late | Independent work, supervision |
| Completion | Journeyman certificate |
| Masterpiece | Required for master status |

### Economic Logic

| Element | Function |
|---------|----------|
| Fee | Compensates master for training |
| Low wages | Balances training investment |
| Duration | Time to learn complex skills |
| Certification | Quality signal |
| Restriction | Limits competition |

### Problems

| Issue | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| Entry barriers | Only wealthy could afford |
| Nepotism | Masters' sons favored |
| Exploitation | Cheap labor, not learning |
| Rigidity | Fixed techniques |
| Blocking | Limited innovation |

## Early Modern Changes

### Guild Decline

| Pressure | Effect |
|----------|--------|
| Proto-industry | Bypassed guilds |
| State opposition | Guilds restrict commerce |
| Technical change | New skills needed |
| Legal reform | Guilds abolished (France 1791) |

### Alternative Training

| Form | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Informal | Learning by doing |
| Family | Father teaches son |
| Migration | Learn in other regions |
| Self-teaching | Books, observation |

### Who Lost Out?

| Group | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| Journeymen | Fewer paths to mastery |
| Apprentices | Less structured training |
| Quality | Standards declined |
| Workers | Less protection |

## Factory Training

### On-the-Job Learning

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Location | In factory |
| Duration | Variable |
| Method | Watching, doing |
| Compensation | Low wages during learning |
| Specificity | Firm-specific skills |

### Deskilling Debate

| View | Argument |
|------|----------|
| Deskilling | Machines reduced skill needs |
| New skills | Different skills required |
| Polarization | Some jobs skilled, many not |
| Evidence | Mixed by industry |

### Company Training

| Development | Examples |
|-------------|----------|
| Large firms | Systematic training programs |
| Technical schools | Company-sponsored |
| Management training | 20th century |
| Professional development | Ongoing |

## Mass Education

### State-Sponsored Human Capital

| Development | Date/Location |
|-------------|---------------|
| Prussia | Compulsory education (1763) |
| France | Napoleonic lycées |
| Britain | Education Acts (1870, 1880) |
| United States | Common schools (19th c.) |
| Japan | Meiji reforms (1872) |

### Why States Invested

| Motivation | Mechanism |
|------------|-----------|
| Military | Literate soldiers |
| Industrial | Skilled workers |
| National | Unified culture, language |
| Political | Citizen formation |
| Economic | Development requires education |

### What Education Provided

| Skill | Function |
|-------|----------|
| Literacy | Reading instructions, records |
| Numeracy | Calculation, measurement |
| Discipline | Time, obedience |
| Knowledge | Science, geography, history |
| Socialization | National identity |

## Vocational Systems

### German Model

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Dual system | School + workplace |
| Apprenticeship | Modern form |
| Industry involvement | Firms train, certify |
| Portability | Skills recognized |
| Duration | 2-3 years |

### Why Germany Succeeded

| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| [[German Business Model]] | Firms invest long-term |
| Industry associations | Coordinate training |
| Quality standards | Certification matters |
| Social status | Apprenticeship respected |
| State support | Framework, funding |

### Comparison

| System | Strengths | Weaknesses |
|--------|-----------|------------|
| German | Practical, employed | Less academic |
| American | Flexible, general | Skill gaps |
| British | Academic track | Vocational weak |
| Japanese | Firm-specific | Limited mobility |

## Human Capital Theory

### Becker's Framework

| Concept | Application |
|---------|-------------|
| Investment | Education as investment |
| Returns | Higher wages, productivity |
| General vs. specific | Portable vs. firm-bound |
| Who pays | General = worker, specific = firm |

### Implications

| Principle | Consequence |
|-----------|-------------|
| Investment logic | Rational calculation |
| Underinvestment | Market failures possible |
| State role | Correct externalities |
| Inequality | Access determines outcomes |

## Contemporary Challenges

### Changing Skill Needs

| Shift | Challenge |
|-------|-----------|
| Automation | Routine skills devalued |
| AI | New displacement |
| Service economy | Different skills |
| Rapid change | Obsolescence faster |

### Skill Formation Today

| Institution | Role |
|-------------|------|
| Schools | General education |
| Universities | Professional, academic |
| Employers | Specific training |
| Online | Supplementary, credentials |
| Lifelong | Continuous updating |

## The Deeper Point

Skill formation institutions shaped labor quality—societies that invested in [[Human Capital|human capital]] compounded the advantages. [[Guild Economics|Medieval guilds]] provided structured training but restricted entry and resisted innovation. Factory systems often deskilled but also created new training needs. Mass education democratized basic skills while creating new hierarchies. [[German Business Model|Vocational systems]] like Germany's showed that apprenticeship could be modernized. The fundamental question persists: who invests, who benefits? Where firms invest in specific skills, workers are bound; where workers invest in general skills, they're mobile but bear costs. Where states invest, access expands but curriculum may mismatch needs. [[Institutions and Progress|Institutional design]] for skill formation involves trade-offs between quality and access, specificity and portability, worker investment and employer investment. The societies that got this right—Prussia, then Germany, then East Asia—developed the human capital that enabled industrialization and sustained growth. Those that underinvested or misallocated—limiting access, emphasizing wrong skills, neglecting vocational education—fell behind. [[Child Labor and Skill Formation|The transition]] from child labor to compulsory education was itself an institutional achievement, replacing extraction from children with investment in children. The returns continue compounding.
