# Mining History

Mining—the extraction of minerals from the earth—has provided essential materials for human economies: copper for bronze, iron for tools, gold and silver for money, coal for industry, and countless other resources. Mining operations have shaped landscapes, driven colonialism, created labor systems, and funded empires. Understanding mining history illuminates resource extraction's role in economic development.
