# Disease and Economic Change

Epidemics are economic shocks. The [[Black Death]] killed half of Europe and reshaped labor markets for generations. Smallpox devastated American populations, enabling colonial conquest. Malaria shaped African development trajectories. Industrial cities were disease factories until sanitation reform. COVID-19 disrupted global supply chains. Disease reveals institutional resilience—societies that could adapt to demographic shocks thrived; those that couldn't collapsed or regressed.

## Overview

| Epidemic | Economic effect |
|----------|-----------------|
| [[Black Death]] | Labor scarcity, wage rise, institutional divergence |
| Columbian Exchange | Population collapse, colonial extraction |
| Industrial disease | Urban mortality, sanitation investment |
| Tropical disease | Development obstacles |
| Modern pandemics | Supply chain, service disruption |

## The Black Death (1346-1353)

### Mortality

| Region | Deaths |
|--------|--------|
| Europe | 30-60% of population |
| Some cities | Up to 80% |
| Some villages | Near total |
| Variation | Enormous by place |

### Immediate Economic Effects

| Effect | Mechanism |
|--------|-----------|
| Labor shortage | Drastic |
| Wages | Rose sharply |
| Rents | Fell (fewer tenants) |
| Land abandonment | Marginal areas |
| Trade disruption | Temporary |

### Long-Term Divergence

| West | East |
|------|------|
| Serfdom declined | Second serfdom |
| Wages stayed high | Wages fell |
| Labor mobile | Labor bound |
| Urban growth | Rural stagnation |
| Foundation for capitalism | Agricultural periphery |

### Why Different Outcomes?

| Factor | West vs. East |
|--------|---------------|
| Cities | Strong vs. weak |
| Lords | Divided vs. united |
| States | Protected peasants vs. supported lords |
| Markets | Developed vs. thin |

## Columbian Exchange

### American Population Collapse

| Region | Population decline |
|--------|-------------------|
| Mexico | 90%+ in first century |
| Caribbean | Near total |
| Peru | 80%+ |
| North America | 80%+ (estimated) |

### Diseases

| Disease | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| Smallpox | Most devastating |
| Measles | Major killer |
| Typhus | Epidemic waves |
| Influenza | Serious mortality |

### Economic Consequences

| Effect | Mechanism |
|--------|-----------|
| Conquest enabled | Weakened resistance |
| Labor shortage | Drove slave trade |
| Land available | For European settlers |
| Encomienda | Labor coercion systems |
| Long-term | Institutional legacy |

## Tropical Disease and Development

### Malaria

| Effect | Mechanism |
|--------|-----------|
| Mortality | Direct death toll |
| Morbidity | Reduced productivity |
| European colonization | Deterred settlement |
| Investment | Reduced European presence |
| Slave trade | Africans more resistant |

### Disease Environment and Institutions

| Acemoglu, Johnson, Robinson thesis | Explanation |
|------------------------------------|-------------|
| High settler mortality | Extractive institutions |
| Low settler mortality | Settler colonies, inclusive institutions |
| Persistence | Institutions outlast disease |
| Correlation | Disease → institutions → development |

### Modern Impact

| Disease | Economic effect |
|---------|-----------------|
| Malaria | ~$12 billion/year, Africa |
| HIV/AIDS | Devastating to working-age adults |
| Neglected diseases | Productivity loss, poverty trap |

## Industrial Health

### Urban Mortality

| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Crowding | Disease transmission |
| Pollution | Respiratory disease |
| Contaminated water | Cholera, typhoid |
| Poor nutrition | Susceptibility |
| Working conditions | Injury, industrial disease |

### Life Expectancy

| Location (1850s) | Years |
|------------------|-------|
| Rural England | ~45 |
| Manchester | ~25 |
| Liverpool | ~25 |

### Sanitation Revolution

| Development | Effect |
|-------------|--------|
| Germ theory | Understanding |
| Clean water | Municipal investment |
| Sewers | Waste removal |
| Food safety | Regulation |
| Life expectancy | Rose dramatically 1870+ |

## Modern Pandemics

### Spanish Flu (1918-1920)

| Impact | Scale |
|--------|-------|
| Deaths | 50-100 million |
| Economic | GDP declines |
| Labor | Workforce reduction |
| Services | Disrupted |
| Long-term | Affected cohorts persistently |

### HIV/AIDS

| Impact | Regions affected |
|--------|------------------|
| Southern Africa | Working-age mortality |
| Economic | Labor force, human capital |
| Institutional | Health system strain |
| Long-term | Orphans, development setback |

### COVID-19

| Impact | Mechanism |
|--------|-----------|
| Lockdowns | Service sector devastation |
| Supply chains | Disruption, reorganization |
| Labor markets | Remote work transformation |
| State role | Fiscal response, vaccine development |
| Inequality | Uneven impact by sector, class |

## Disease and Institutional Response

### Quarantine

| Origin | Venetian practice |
|--------|-------------------|
| Purpose | Limit contagion |
| Institution | State capacity required |
| Trade-off | Commerce vs. health |
| Modern | Airport screening, border control |

### Public Health

| Development | Significance |
|-------------|--------------|
| Sanitation | State investment in infrastructure |
| Vaccination | Collective action problem |
| Regulation | Food, water, workplace safety |
| Healthcare systems | Institutional variation |

### Institutional Resilience

| What helped | What hurt |
|-------------|-----------|
| State capacity | Weak states |
| Flexible labor markets | Rigid systems |
| Surplus | Subsistence margins |
| Adaptation | Rigid institutions |

## The Deeper Point

Epidemics reveal [[Institutions and Progress|institutional]] resilience. The same [[Black Death]] shock produced opposite outcomes in Western and Eastern Europe—the difference was prior institutional context. The [[Late Medieval Crisis|plague]] created labor scarcity everywhere, but where cities were strong and lords divided (West), peasants gained freedom; where lords controlled legislatures (East), they imposed second serfdom. The Columbian Exchange's demographic catastrophe enabled extraction colonies with persistent institutional damage. Tropical disease shaped colonial settlement patterns, which shaped institutions, which shaped development—a causal chain from microbes to modern poverty. Industrial cities were disease factories until institutions (sanitation, public health) adapted. The pattern: disease is the shock, but institutions determine the outcome. Societies with [[State Capacity|capable states]], flexible labor markets, and surplus could absorb and adapt. Those without collapsed or regressed. Disease doesn't cause development failure—institutional failure to respond to disease does.
