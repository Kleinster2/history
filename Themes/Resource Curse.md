# Resource Curse

The resource curse—the paradox that resource-rich countries often grow slower than resource-poor ones—is one of the strongest empirical regularities in development economics. Nigeria has oil; Norway has oil. One is rich, one isn't. The difference isn't geology; it's [[Institutions and Progress|institutions]]. Natural resource wealth can fund development or corrupt governance, build infrastructure or finance civil war, attract investment or crowd out manufacturing—depending entirely on the institutional framework that manages it.

## Overview

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Definition | Resource abundance associated with poor development |
| Paradox | More wealth → worse outcomes |
| Key mechanism | Institutions, not geography |
| Coined by | Richard Auty (1993) |
| Major study | Sachs & Warner (1995, 2001) |

## The Evidence

### Resource-Rich Underperformers

| Country | Resource | GDP Per Capita | Outcome |
|---------|----------|----------------|---------|
| Nigeria | Oil | Low | Poverty despite decades of oil |
| Venezuela | Oil | Declining | Economic collapse |
| DRC | Minerals | Very low | Conflict, poverty |
| Angola | Oil, diamonds | Low | Inequality, conflict |
| Iraq | Oil | Low | Conflict, instability |

### Resource-Rich Successes

| Country | Resource | GDP Per Capita | Key Difference |
|---------|----------|----------------|----------------|
| Norway | Oil | Very high | Sovereign wealth fund, democracy |
| Botswana | Diamonds | Upper-middle | Good governance, prudent management |
| Chile | Copper | Upper-middle | Stabilization fund, diversification |
| Australia | Minerals | High | Strong institutions pre-resource |
| Canada | Oil, minerals | High | Diversified, federal democracy |

### The Pattern

| Condition | Likely Outcome |
|-----------|----------------|
| Resources + strong institutions | Development |
| Resources + weak institutions | Curse |
| Resources before institutions | Usually curse |
| Institutions before resources | Usually managed |

## Mechanisms

### 1. Dutch Disease

| Step | Effect |
|------|--------|
| Resource exports | Currency appreciates |
| Strong currency | Manufacturing uncompetitive |
| Manufacturing declines | Deindustrialization |
| Economy depends on one export | Vulnerability |
| Named for | Netherlands after North Sea gas (1960s) |

### 2. Rentier State

| Feature | Mechanism |
|---------|-----------|
| Revenue without taxation | No fiscal bargain with citizens |
| No taxation → no representation | Accountability broken |
| State distributes, doesn't extract | Patronage replaces governance |
| Citizens as clients | Not stakeholders |
| Result | Authoritarianism sustainable |

### 3. Institutional Degradation

| Step | Logic |
|------|-------|
| Windfall revenue | Reduces pressure for reform |
| Easy money | Corruption opportunities multiply |
| Patronage | Talent flows to politics, not production |
| [[State Capacity]] | Atrophies (not needed for revenue) |
| [[Property Rights]] | Weakened (state can take) |

### 4. Volatility

| Problem | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| Commodity price swings | Revenue unpredictable |
| Boom | Overspending, Dutch disease |
| Bust | Fiscal crisis, debt |
| Cycle | Impossible to plan long-term |
| Investment | Deterred by uncertainty |

### 5. Conflict

| Mechanism | Examples |
|-----------|---------|
| "Prize" to control | State capture worth fighting for |
| Finance for rebels | Diamonds, oil fund insurgency |
| Separatism | Resource regions want independence |
| Greed over grievance | Collier's argument |
| Examples | Sierra Leone, South Sudan, Libya |

## Historical Cases

### Spanish Empire: The Original Curse

| Feature | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| [[Silver Economy\|Silver]] floods | Inflation (Price Revolution) |
| Manufacturing | Declined (imports cheaper) |
| Institutions | Monarchy not accountable |
| Investment | In war, not production |
| Result | [[Spanish Empire Economy\|Decline]] despite being richest |
| Lesson | First modern resource curse |

### Oil Economies

| Country | Discovery | Institutional Quality Pre-Oil | Outcome |
|---------|-----------|-------------------------------|---------|
| Norway | 1969 | Strong democracy | Success |
| Saudi Arabia | 1938 | Tribal monarchy | Rentier state |
| Nigeria | 1956 | Weak post-colonial | Corruption, conflict |
| UAE | 1958 | Tribal, small population | Managed development |
| Venezuela | 1920s | Weak democracy | Eventual collapse |

### Botswana: Africa's Counter-Example

| Factor | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Diamonds discovered | 1967 |
| Pre-existing institutions | Tswana chieftaincy, checks on power |
| Policy | Saved revenues, invested in education |
| Governance | Transparent, relatively uncorrupt |
| Result | Fastest-growing economy 1965-1995 |
| Lesson | Institutions before resources = managed wealth |

## Escape Strategies

### Sovereign Wealth Funds

| Fund | Country | Size |
|------|---------|------|
| Government Pension Fund | Norway | $1.4 trillion |
| Abu Dhabi Investment Authority | UAE | $900+ billion |
| Kuwait Investment Authority | Kuwait | $750+ billion |
| Logic | Save windfall, invest for future |
| Problem | Requires governance to protect fund from politics |

### Diversification

| Strategy | Example |
|----------|---------|
| Invest in manufacturing | Malaysia (palm oil → electronics) |
| Education spending | Botswana (diamond revenue → schools) |
| Infrastructure | UAE (oil revenue → logistics hub) |
| Services | Dubai (oil → finance, tourism) |
| Challenge | Why diversify when resource is profitable? |

### Institutional Pre-Commitment

| Tool | Function |
|------|----------|
| Fiscal rules | Limit spending during booms |
| Stabilization funds | Save for busts |
| Transparency laws | EITI (Extractive Industries Transparency) |
| Central bank independence | Shield from political pressure |
| Problem | Rules can be changed when convenient |

## Debates

### Is the Curse Real?

| Position | Argument |
|----------|----------|
| Yes (Sachs & Warner) | Statistical correlation robust |
| Conditional (Mehlum et al.) | Only with bad institutions |
| No (Alexeev & Conrad) | Oil countries richer than otherwise |
| Nuanced | Resources amplify institutional quality |
| Consensus | Not deterministic; institutional mediation |

### Resources and Democracy

| View | Evidence |
|------|----------|
| Oil hinders democracy | Ross (2001, 2012) |
| Rentier state theory | No taxation, no representation |
| Counter | Norway, Canada, Australia |
| Resolution | Resources hinder democratization; don't reverse established democracy |

## The Deeper Point

The resource curse is the vault's purest natural experiment in [[Institutions and Progress|institutional]] quality: identical geological endowments produce radically different outcomes depending solely on the institutional framework managing them. Norway and Nigeria both discovered oil; one channeled the windfall into a sovereign wealth fund that now exceeds $1 trillion, the other into patronage networks that left most citizens poorer than before. The mechanism is Baumol applied to states: resource revenue creates an enormous prize, and [[Entrepreneurship|entrepreneurial]] talent flows toward capturing that prize (politics, corruption, rent-seeking) rather than toward production—*unless* institutions force the revenue into productive channels. The deeper insight connects to [[State Capacity]]: the resource curse is really a *taxation curse*—states that don't need to tax citizens don't need to bargain with them, don't need to build administrative capacity to reach them, and don't need to provide services to maintain legitimacy. Tilly's thesis in reverse: where European wars forced states to build fiscal capacity (and citizens demanded representation in return), resource states skip this bargain entirely, building coercive capacity without administrative or democratic capacity. The [[Spanish Empire Economy|Spanish Empire]]—Europe's first resource curse—proves the pattern isn't new: Philip II's silver funded wars rather than institutions, and Spain declined while resource-poor Netherlands and England industrialized. [[Creative Destruction|Creative destruction]] requires a diversified economy where new firms can challenge old ones; resource monocultures concentrate power in whoever controls the single revenue stream. The escape—sovereign wealth funds, fiscal rules, diversification—is always institutional, never geological.
