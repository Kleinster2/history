# Urbanization

Cities are where civilization concentrates—hubs of trade, production, power, and ideas. From Uruk (the first city) to modern megacities, urbanization has driven economic development. Cities enable specialization, market exchange, and innovation. But they also concentrate poverty, disease, and inequality. The story of urbanization is the story of how humanity organized itself for production.
