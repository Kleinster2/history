# Financial Crisis Theory

Financial crises are features, not bugs, of market economies. From the South Sea Bubble (1720) to the 2008 collapse, the pattern recurs: expansion, euphoria, overextension, panic, crash. Kindleberger documented the sequence; Minsky explained the mechanism; Reinhart and Rogoff proved the universality. Crises occur because the same behaviors that drive growth—borrowing, risk-taking, innovation—become excessive when success breeds confidence and confidence breeds leverage. Understanding crisis theory is essential for understanding why [[Institutions and Progress|institutions]] matter: they can dampen but not eliminate financial instability.

## Overview

### Why Crises Recur

| Factor | Mechanism |
|--------|-----------|
| Human psychology | Euphoria, panic, herding |
| Memory fade | "This time is different" |
| Leverage | Small shocks → big failures |
| Interconnection | Contagion through networks |
| Innovation | New instruments, old risks |
| Regulation | Always fighting last crisis |

### The Crisis Roll Call

| Century | Major Crises |
|---------|--------------|
| 18th | South Sea Bubble (1720), Mississippi (1720) |
| 19th | 1825, 1837, 1857, 1873, 1893 |
| 20th | 1907, 1929, 1970s (stagflation), 1987, 1997-98 |
| 21st | 2008, COVID (2020), ongoing |
| See | [[Financial Crises]], [[Great Depression]] |

## The Kindleberger Model

### The Sequence

| Phase | Character |
|-------|-----------|
| Displacement | New opportunity—technology, policy, war |
| Boom | Credit expands, prices rise |
| Euphoria | Everyone's making money |
| Financial distress | Insiders sell, outsiders doubt |
| Revulsion | Panic, crash, depression |

### Key Concepts

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Displacement | Shock that creates profit opportunity |
| Overtrading | Speculation exceeds fundamentals |
| Monetary expansion | Credit fuels the boom |
| Swindles | Fraud exposed by crash |
| Lender of last resort | What stops the panic |

### Historical Examples

| Displacement | Crisis |
|--------------|--------|
| War stress | [[Bank of Amsterdam]] (1780s) |
| New territories | South Sea, Mississippi (1720) |
| Railroads | 1873, 1893 |
| New technologies | 1929, Dot-com (2000) |
| Financial innovation | 2008 (securitization) |
| Emerging markets | 1997-98 (Asia) |

## The Minsky Model

### Hyman Minsky's Insight

Financial stability breeds instability. Success makes people confident; confidence makes them borrow more; more borrowing makes the system fragile; fragility eventually produces crisis.

### The Three Types of Finance

| Type | Character |
|------|-----------|
| Hedge finance | Income covers interest AND principal |
| Speculative finance | Income covers interest only (must roll over principal) |
| [[Ponzi Schemes\|Ponzi finance]] | Income covers neither (depends on asset appreciation) |

### The Cycle

| Phase | What Happens |
|-------|--------------|
| Stability | Hedge finance dominates |
| Expansion | Success → more borrowing |
| Euphoria | Shift to speculative/[[Ponzi Schemes\|Ponzi]] |
| Fragility | Small shock can trigger collapse |
| Minsky moment | The trigger occurs |
| Crash | Forced deleveraging |

### Why It's Endogenous

| Point | Implication |
|-------|-------------|
| Stability is destabilizing | Good times create risk |
| Can't prevent forever | System generates its own crises |
| Memory | Forgetting enables repetition |
| Policy paradox | Preventing small crises enables big ones |

## Reinhart-Rogoff: 800 Years

### The Pattern

| Finding | Evidence |
|---------|----------|
| Crises are universal | All countries, all eras |
| "This time is different" | Always believed, always wrong |
| Debt precedes crisis | Buildup, then crash |
| Recovery is slow | 5-10 years to pre-crisis GDP |
| Banking crises worst | Deeper, longer recessions |

### Types of Crises

| Type | Characteristics |
|------|-----------------|
| Banking | Bank failures, credit contraction |
| Currency | Devaluation, capital flight |
| Sovereign debt | Government default/restructuring |
| Inflation | Hyperinflation episodes |
| Twin/triple | Multiple types together—worst |

### The Variables That Matter

| Variable | Signal |
|----------|--------|
| Credit growth | Rapid expansion precedes crashes |
| Asset prices | Real estate, stocks bubble |
| Current account | Large deficits = vulnerability |
| External debt | Foreign currency borrowing |
| Fiscal position | Sovereign's capacity to respond |

---

## Crisis Mechanisms

### Leverage

| Concept | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| Definition | Borrowed money amplifies returns |
| Upside | 10x leverage = 10x gains |
| Downside | 10x leverage = 10x losses |
| Margin call | Must sell when prices fall |
| Fire sale | Selling drives prices down further |
| Deleveraging | Everyone selling at once |

### Bank Runs

| Mechanism | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Maturity mismatch | Banks borrow short, lend long |
| Confidence | System works if depositors don't panic |
| Run | Rational if others are running |
| Self-fulfilling | Bank fails because of run |
| Diamond-Dybvig | Nobel Prize for run theory |

### Contagion

| Channel | How It Spreads |
|---------|----------------|
| Counterparty | If A fails, B's claims on A worthless |
| Funding | Lenders pull back across the board |
| Information | If A is bad, maybe B is too |
| Fire sales | A's selling drives down B's assets |
| Psychology | Panic spreads |

### The Doom Loop

| Step | Mechanism |
|------|-----------|
| Banks hold government bonds | Standard practice |
| Government guarantees banks | Implicit or explicit |
| Sovereign stress | Bond prices fall |
| Bank losses | Balance sheets weaken |
| Bailout costs | Fiscal pressure increases |
| Spiral | Each worsens the other |

## Policy Responses

### Lender of Last Resort

| Principle | Bagehot's Dictum (1873) |
|-----------|------------------------|
| Lend freely | To solvent institutions |
| At penalty rates | Discourage abuse |
| Against good collateral | Limit risk |
| Problem | Hard to distinguish solvent from insolvent |
| See | [[Central Banking]] |

### Deposit Insurance

| Feature | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| Created | FDIC (1934) in US |
| Purpose | Prevent bank runs |
| Moral hazard | Banks take more risk |
| Limit | Currently $250K per account |
| Trade-off | Stability vs. discipline |

### Bailouts

| Issue | Debate |
|-------|--------|
| Too big to fail | Some institutions can't be allowed to fail |
| Moral hazard | Creates incentive for risk |
| Alternatives | Bail-in, resolution regimes |
| Political | Taxpayer anger |
| 2008 | TARP, AIG, etc.—$700B+ |

### Macroprudential Regulation

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Capital requirements | Banks hold more equity |
| Countercyclical buffers | Increase capital in booms |
| Stress tests | Check resilience to shocks |
| LTV limits | Constrain mortgage lending |
| Systemic risk oversight | Monitor buildup |

## Why Crises Aren't Prevented

### The Knowledge Problem

| Costs of prevention | Slowing growth is unpopular |
| Industry capture | Finance shapes regulation |
| Revolving door | Regulators → banks → regulators |

## The Deeper Point

Financial crisis theory is the dark side of [[Institutions and Progress|institutional]] economics: the same mechanisms that channel [[Entrepreneurship|entrepreneurial]] energy into productive investment can channel it into destructive speculation. The Minsky cycle is Baumol's thesis applied to finance: in boom times, the rewards to speculative and Ponzi finance exceed those to hedge finance, so ambitious operators shift accordingly. Institutions—lender of last resort, deposit insurance, capital requirements—can dampen the cycle but not eliminate it. Each innovation (securitization, derivatives, crypto) finds the gaps in existing rules. The "this time is different" syndrome reflects genuine uncertainty: sometimes new technologies or institutional changes do shift possibilities, and distinguishing genuine innovation from bubble is hard in real time. The deeper lesson is that financial systems have inherent instability that can be managed but not cured. [[Central Banking]] and [[Business Regulation]] are institutional responses to this reality—but they create their own problems (moral hazard, regulatory capture, procyclicality). The 800 years of data from Reinhart-Rogoff prove the universality: different countries, different eras, same pattern. Financial crises will recur. The question is whether institutions make them less frequent and less severe—and whether the costs of crisis are borne by those who profited from the boom.
