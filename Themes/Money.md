# Money

Money is one of humanity's most consequential inventions—a technology so successful that we forget it's a technology. From cowrie shells to cryptocurrency, money solved the fundamental problem of exchange: how to trade with strangers across time and space. Its evolution tracks economic progress itself.

## The Problem Money Solves

### Barter's Limits

| Problem | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Double coincidence of wants | I have fish, want wheat; you must have wheat, want fish |
| Indivisibility | Can't split a cow to buy a chicken |
| Lack of standard | How many fish equal one sheep? |
| Storage | Fish rots; wheat spoils |
| Time mismatch | Harvest once, eat all year |

### What Money Does

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Medium of exchange | Accepted for any transaction |
| Unit of account | Common measure of value |
| Store of value | Wealth preserved over time |
| Standard of deferred payment | Enables credit, debt |

| China | Cowries, silk | 2000+ BCE |
| Africa | Cowries, salt, cattle | Ancient-modern |
| Americas | Cacao, cloth, copper axes | Pre-Columbian |
| Pacific | Shell money, stone discs | Traditional |

### Why These Items?

| Quality | Requirement |
|---------|-------------|
| Durable | Doesn't rot or break |
| Portable | Carries easily |
| Divisible | Can make change |
| Recognizable | Easy to verify |
| Scarce | Limited supply |
| Desirable | Intrinsic value helps |

### Mesopotamian Silver

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Form | Weighed silver pieces |
| Unit | Shekel (~8.3 grams) |
| Use | Large transactions, accounts |
| Verification | Weighed each transaction |

**Not coins—just weighed metal. Every transaction required scales.**

### The Cowrie Shell

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Species | Cypraea moneta |
| Source | Indian Ocean |
| Distribution | China, Africa, Pacific |
| Duration | 3,500+ years of use |
| Last use | 20th century (parts of Africa) |

**The world's longest-used currency—because shells are durable, portable, hard to counterfeit, and impossible to make locally in most places.**

## Comparative Perspectives

### Who Didn't Need Coins

| Society | Alternative |

### Why Coins Spread

| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| State advantage | Easier taxation |
| Trade advantage | Reduced transaction costs |
| Military needs | Pay soldiers |
| Conquest | Imposed on conquered |

### The Inca Alternative

The Inca ran an empire of 12 million without any money—proving money is not universal, just very useful.
