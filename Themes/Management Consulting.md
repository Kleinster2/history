# Management Consulting

Management consulting is the profession that sells organizational knowledge. From Frederick Taylor's efficiency studies through McKinsey's strategy frameworks to today's digital transformation, consultants have shaped how businesses think about themselves. The industry's rise reflects a profound shift: management became something that could be analyzed, codified, and transferred across firms. Whether consultants create genuine value or extract rents from insecure executives is debated, but their influence on business practice is undeniable. The big three strategy firms (McKinsey, BCG, Bain) function as finishing schools for corporate leadership worldwide.

## The Deeper Point

Management consulting exists because management knowledge is imperfectly appropriable: firms can't fully capture the value of their organizational innovations, so a market for external expertise emerges. The consulting industry is [[Creative Destruction|creative destruction]] applied to management practice—consultants observe best practices, abstract them into transferable frameworks, and spread them across clients, accelerating the diffusion of organizational innovation while extracting rents in the process. The McKinsey model—[[Foundational Firms|Marvin Bower's]] creation of the professional partnership serving CEOs—was itself a business innovation as consequential as any of the strategies the firm has recommended. Whether consultants create value or extract it depends on the engagement: genuine insight that clients couldn't generate internally creates value; politically useful cover for decisions already made is pure transfer. The critique has force: consultants' incentives (sell more work, avoid blame, maintain relationships) don't always align with client interests. But the industry's persistence and growth suggests it solves a real problem: bringing external perspective and specialized knowledge to organizations that can't develop it internally. [[Varieties of Capitalism|Different business systems]] use consulting differently—American firms use it heavily, German Mittelstand less so—reflecting deeper institutional differences in how firms learn and change. The deeper insight: the rise of consulting reflects the professionalization of management itself—the belief that running organizations is a skill that can be analyzed, taught, and transferred, rather than an art learned only through experience.
