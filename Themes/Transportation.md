# Transportation

How moving goods shaped economic possibility. Transportation costs determine what trades, where people live, and how economies organize. Every major reduction in these costs—from pack animals to ships to railways to containers—transformed economic geography and enabled new forms of specialization.

## The Cost Curve

| Era | Technology | Cost per Ton-Mile |
|-----|------------|-------------------|
| Ancient | Pack animal | Highest (1x baseline) |
| Ancient | Cart/wagon | ~60% of pack |
| Ancient-1800s | River barge | ~20% of cart |
| Ancient-1800s | Sea vessel | ~10% of river |
| 1830s+ | Railway | ~25% of sea |
| 1950s+ | Container ship | ~5% of bulk ship |
| 1970s+ | Air freight | Higher, but fast |

## Why Costs Matter

### Trade Radius

| Transport | Economic Trade Radius |
|-----------|----------------------|
| Human porter | ~10 miles (subsistence goods) |
| Pack animal | ~50 miles |
| Cart | ~100 miles |
| River | Hundreds of miles |
| Sea | Thousands of miles |
| Rail | Continents |
| Container | Global |

### What Trades

| Low Cost | High Cost |
|----------|-----------|
| Bulk commodities | Only luxuries |
| Raw materials | Processed goods |
| Ordinary goods | Precious metals, spices |
| Mass markets | Elite consumption |

## Historical Phases

### Ancient World

| Mode | Character |
|------|-----------|
| Rivers | Nile, Tigris-Euphrates, Yangtze |
| Sea | Mediterranean, Indian Ocean |
| Roads | Roman network, Persian Royal Road |
| Caravans | Silk Road, trans-Saharan |

### Medieval

| Development | Impact |
|-------------|--------|
| Improved ships | Northern European trade |
| Canals | Chinese Grand Canal |
| Better wagons | Limited improvement |
| Portage | River system connections |

### Early Modern

| Development | Impact |
|-------------|--------|
| Ocean navigation | Global trade |
| Canal building | Industrial Britain |
| Road improvement | Turnpikes, macadam |
| Still pre-rail | Water dominates |

### Industrial Era

| Technology | Impact |
|------------|--------|
| [[Railroad Revolution\|Railways]] | Continental integration |
| Steamships | Reliable ocean schedules |
| Suez Canal (1869) | Asia-Europe route |
| Panama Canal (1914) | Atlantic-Pacific link |

### Modern

| Technology | Impact |
|------------|--------|
| Motor vehicles | Door-to-door flexibility |
| Aviation | Speed for high-value |
| [[Containerization]] | Standardization revolution |
| Intermodal | Seamless global logistics |

## Economics of Transport

### What Determines Costs

| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Distance | Obviously increases cost |
| Terrain | Mountains, deserts costly |
| Mode | Water cheapest, air most expensive |
| Infrastructure | Investment required |
| Scale | Bulk reduces per-unit cost |

### Infrastructure as Public Good

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| High fixed costs | State investment |
| Network effects | Coordination needed |
| Free rider | Tolls, taxes |
| Natural monopoly | Regulation |

## Geographic Determinism?

### Advantages of Location

| Feature | Economic Effect |
|---------|-----------------|
| River access | Cheap bulk transport |
| Coastal position | Maritime trade |
| Flat terrain | Road/rail easier |
| Mountain passes | Chokepoint control |

### But Institutions Matter

| Case | Lesson |
|------|--------|
| Netherlands | Poor soil, great wealth (trade institutions) |
| Central Asia | Good location, variable outcomes |
| Britain | Island, but built canal/rail networks |
| Switzerland | Mountains, but high income (institutions) |

## Key Innovations

### The Wheel

| Feature | Limitation |
|---------|------------|
| Dates to ~3500 BCE | Mesopotamia |
| Requires roads | Infrastructure-intensive |
| Terrain-sensitive | Mountains, forests problematic |
| Still costly | Water transport cheaper |

### The Ship

| Evolution | Impact |
|----------|--------|
| Reed boats | River transport |
| Sail | Wind power, ocean crossing |
| Multiple masts | Larger vessels |
| Steam | Schedule reliability |
| Container | Standardization |

### The Railway

| Impact | Evidence |
|--------|----------|
| Land transport revolution | First cheap overland bulk |
| National markets | US, Germany integration |
| Time standardization | Railway time zones |
| Organizational innovation | First big business |

### The Container

| Impact | Evidence |
|--------|----------|
| Costs dropped 90% | Port handling transformed |
| Global supply chains | Parts from everywhere |
| Port geography | Deep water, automation |
| Trade explosion | Post-1970 globalization |

## The Deeper Point

Transportation costs are among the most fundamental constraints in [[Institutions and Progress|economic history]]. When moving goods is expensive, trade stays local, specialization stays limited, and markets stay small. Every reduction in transport costs expands what's possible—larger markets, finer specialization, more complex supply chains.

But transportation infrastructure doesn't build itself. Roads, canals, ports, and railways require investment—usually public or public-private. The societies that built transport networks gained advantages; those that didn't fell behind. China's Grand Canal, Rome's roads, Britain's canals and rails, America's railways and highways—all required institutional capacity to mobilize resources.

The geography matters, but institutions determine whether geographic advantages get exploited. The Mediterranean was always there, but Mediterranean trade expanded when institutions (Phoenician networks, Greek colonies, Roman peace) enabled it. The potential for railways existed everywhere, but construction happened where capital, technology, and political will converged.

Transportation is infrastructure in the deepest sense: the foundation on which other economic activity builds. Reducing transport costs is among the most reliable development strategies in history.
