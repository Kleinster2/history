# Dutch Disease

When resource wealth harms the broader economy. Named for the Netherlands' experience after discovering natural gas in the 1960s, Dutch disease describes how a booming export sector—typically natural resources—can damage other tradable sectors through exchange rate appreciation and labor market competition.

## The Mechanism

### How It Works

| Step | Effect |
|------|--------|
| 1. Resource discovery | New export revenue |
| 2. Foreign exchange inflow | Currency appreciates |
| 3. Other exports | Become less competitive |
| 4. Manufacturing | Declines (priced out) |
| 5. Services | Expand (non-tradable) |

### Two Effects

| Effect | Mechanism |
|--------|-----------|
| Spending effect | Resource revenue spent → demand for services → draws labor from manufacturing |
| Resource movement | Higher wages in resource sector → draws labor from manufacturing |

### Currency Appreciation

| Process | Consequence |
|---------|-------------|
| Export revenues | Demand for domestic currency |
| Appreciation | Makes imports cheaper |
| Manufacturing exports | Become expensive abroad |
| Import competition | Domestic products lose |

## The Classic Case: Netherlands

### Timeline

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| 1959 | Groningen gas field discovered |
| 1960s | Gas exports boom |
| 1970s | Manufacturing decline noted |
| 1977 | Term "Dutch disease" coined (Economist) |

### Effects

| Sector | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Gas | Booming exports |
| Guilder | Appreciated |
| Manufacturing | Lost competitiveness |
| Employment | Shifted to services |

## Other Cases

### Oil Exporters

| Country | Pattern |
|---------|---------|
| Nigeria | Oil boom → manufacturing collapse |
| Venezuela | Oil dependence → no diversification |
| Saudi Arabia | Limited non-oil sector |
| Norway | Managed successfully (see below) |

### Non-Oil Examples

| Country | Resource | Effect |
|---------|----------|--------|
| Australia | Mining boom 2000s | Manufacturing pressure |
| UK | North Sea oil | 1980s manufacturing decline |
| Chile | Copper | Managed through sovereign fund |
| Botswana | Diamonds | Careful macroeconomic management |

## Broader Economic Damage

### Beyond Manufacturing

| Problem | Mechanism |
|---------|-----------|
| Skill loss | Manufacturing capabilities atrophy |
| Innovation decline | Learning-by-doing reduced |
| Volatility | Commodity prices swing |
| Long-term growth | Manufacturing spillovers lost |

### Institutional Effects

| Problem | Mechanism |
|---------|-----------|
| Rent-seeking | Fight for resource revenues |
| Weak taxation | No need to tax citizens |
| State capture | Resource revenues concentrate power |
| Corruption | Temptation of easy money |

This overlap with [[Resource Curse]] makes Dutch disease particularly damaging.

## Why Manufacturing Matters

### Arguments for Manufacturing

| Benefit | Evidence |
|---------|----------|
| Learning by doing | Productivity growth |
| Spillovers | Technology diffusion |
| Employment | Middle-skill jobs |
| Export diversification | Reduces volatility |

### The Counterargument

| Point | Response |
|-------|----------|
| Comparative advantage | Resources ARE the advantage |
| Services can substitute | Some sectors have spillovers too |
| Forced industrialization | Often fails |
| But: diversification | Still matters for stability |

## Policy Responses

### Saving Resource Revenues

| Policy | Example |
|--------|---------|
| Sovereign wealth fund | Norway's Government Pension Fund |
| Stabilization fund | Chile's copper fund |
| Future generations | Kuwait Investment Authority |
| Effect | Reduces spending effect, currency pressure |

### Sterilization

| Policy | Mechanism |
|--------|-----------|
| Central bank intervention | Buy foreign currency |
| Fiscal restraint | Don't spend all revenues |
| Capital controls | Limit inflows |
| Effect | Reduce appreciation pressure |

### Industrial Policy

| Policy | Example |
|--------|---------|
| Subsidies | Support manufacturing |
| Trade barriers | Protect domestic industry |
| Local content | Require domestic sourcing |
| Risk | Inefficiency, rent-seeking |

## Success Stories

### Norway

| Policy | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Oil fund | Saves most revenue |
| Fiscal rule | Limited spending |
| Investment abroad | Reduces domestic pressure |
| Result | Manufacturing survives, wealth preserved |

### Botswana

| Policy | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Pula Fund | Stabilization savings |
| Cautious spending | Gradual increase |
| Institutional strength | Pre-existing democracy |
| Result | Sustained growth, avoided curse |

### Chile

| Policy | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Copper stabilization fund | Saves windfall |
| Fiscal rule | Structural balance |
| Central bank independence | Sound policy |
| Result | Managed volatility |

## The Deeper Point

Dutch disease is a specific mechanism within the broader [[Resource Curse]]—showing how even politically stable countries can suffer from resource abundance through purely economic channels. The currency appreciation is automatic; no corruption or rent-seeking required.

But the policy responses show that Dutch disease is manageable. Norway, Botswana, and Chile demonstrate that institutional arrangements—sovereign funds, fiscal rules, independent central banks—can contain the damage. The disease is neither inevitable nor incurable.

The [[Institutions and Progress|institutional]] lesson is that resource discoveries create policy challenges that require deliberate solutions. Left to market forces alone, the exchange rate appreciation will harm manufacturing. Preventing this requires conscious intervention—saving revenues, sterilizing inflows, maintaining fiscal discipline.

Dutch disease also reveals a deeper truth about economic development. Manufacturing isn't just another sector; it has properties—learning, spillovers, diversification—that matter for long-term growth. When resource booms crowd out manufacturing, countries may gain income today at the cost of capabilities tomorrow.

The question isn't whether resources are good or bad, but whether institutions can manage the macroeconomic challenges they create.
