# Silk Road

The Silk Road—a network of overland routes connecting China to the Mediterranean—facilitated the exchange of goods, ideas, religions, and technologies for over 1,500 years. Named for China's most famous export, the routes carried far more than silk: Buddhism traveled east, Islam spread across Central Asia, and technologies like paper and gunpowder diffused westward. The Silk Road demonstrates how commerce creates cultural transformation.
