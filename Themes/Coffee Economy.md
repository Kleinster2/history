# Coffee Economy

The commodity that shaped Latin America. Coffee shows how a single commodity can shape [[Institutions and Progress|institutions]]—plantation labor systems, oligarchic politics, export dependence all followed from the crop's economics.

## The Plant and Its Economics

### Coffee Characteristics

| Feature | Economic Implication |
|---------|---------------------|
| Tropical highland | Specific geography required |
| Perennial bush | Long-term investment (3-5 years to first harvest) |
| Labor-intensive | Picking requires hands, not machines |
| Processing required | Wet or dry method, infrastructure needed |
| Perishable | Must process quickly |
| Quality variation | Terroir, processing, variety matter |

### Why Coffee Became Global

| Factor | Mechanism |
|--------|-----------|
| Stimulant | Caffeine demand |
| Taste | Acquired, then addictive |
| Social | Coffeehouses, rituals |
| Transportable | Roasted beans travel well |
| Tropical | Couldn't grow in consuming countries |

## Origins and Spread

### Ethiopian Origins

| Period | Development |
|--------|-------------|
| Pre-1400 | Wild coffee in Ethiopian highlands |
| 1400s | Cultivation in Yemen |
| 1500s | Spread through Ottoman Empire |
| Coffeehouses | Istanbul, Cairo, Damascus |

### Global Spread

| Destination | Date | Vector |
|-------------|------|--------|
| Yemen (Mocha) | 1400s | Arab traders |
| India (Mysore) | 1600s | Smuggled seeds |
| Java (Indonesia) | 1699 | Dutch |
| Caribbean (Martinique) | 1723 | French |
| Brazil | 1727 | Portuguese smuggled from French Guiana |
| Central America | 1800s | From Caribbean |

## Brazilian Dominance

### Scale of Production

| Year | Brazil's Share of World Production |
|------|-----------------------------------|
| 1850 | 50% |
| 1900 | 75% |
| 1950 | 50% |
| 2020 | 35% |

### The Fazenda System

| Feature | Characteristic |
|---------|----------------|
| Large estates | Latifundia model |
| Slave labor (to 1888) | Then immigrant labor |
| Vertical integration | Growing, processing, exporting |
| São Paulo concentration | Vale do Paraíba, then west |
| Political power | Coffee planters = oligarchy |

### Labor Transitions

| Era | Labor System |
|-----|--------------|
| 1820-1888 | Slavery |
| 1888-1930 | European immigration (colonato system) |
| 1930-present | Wage labor, sharecropping |

### Valorization Schemes

| Policy | Mechanism |
|--------|-----------|
| Problem | Overproduction, price collapse |
| Taubaté Convention (1906) | States buy surplus to support price |
| Federal takeover | National coffee policies |
| Burning coffee | 1930s destruction to raise prices |
| Outcome | Delayed market adjustment, eventually failed |

## Central American Coffee

### Coffee Republics

| Country | Coffee Dominance |
|---------|-----------------|
| Guatemala | Oligarchy, forced labor (mandamiento) |
| El Salvador | 14 families controlled economy |
| Costa Rica | Smaller farms, more democratic |
| Honduras | Less dominant, came later |
| Nicaragua | Landed elite, Somoza connections |

### Labor Systems

| System | Country |
|--------|---------|
| Forced labor (abolished slowly) | Guatemala |
| Debt peonage | El Salvador |
| Smallholder | Costa Rica |
| Wage labor | Variable |

### Political Consequences

| Effect | Manifestation |
|--------|---------------|
| Oligarchic control | Coffee elite = political elite |
| Land concentration | Peasant dispossession |
| Military-oligarch alliances | Repression of labor |
| Cold War conflicts | Coffee areas = revolution zones |

## Colombian Model

### Fedecafé System

| Feature | Design |
|---------|--------|
| Federation created | 1927 |
| Function | Price stabilization, quality control |
| Juan Valdez | Brand marketing |
| Small farmers | More than plantations |
| Parafiscal fund | Coffee tax for stabilization |

### Why Colombia Different

| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Geography | Mountainous, small plots |
| Settlement pattern | Smallholder colonization |
| Federation | Collective action |
| Quality focus | Premium positioning |

## Global Coffee Market

### Price Volatility

| Pattern | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| Boom-bust cycles | Investment → overproduction → crash |
| 1970s boom | Frost in Brazil |
| 1990s collapse | Vietnam production, ICA ended |
| 2000s partial recovery | Specialty market |
| Volatility | Farmer vulnerability |

### International Coffee Agreement (1962-1989)

| Feature | Mechanism |
|---------|-----------|
| Export quotas | Limit supply |
| Price band | Support floor |
| Members | Producers and consumers |
| End | 1989, Cold War ended |
| Aftermath | Prices collapsed |

### The Coffee Crisis (1999-2004)

| Cause | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| Vietnam production | New major producer |
| ICA end | No supply management |
| Low prices | Below cost of production |
| Social crisis | Farmer abandonment, migration |

## Contemporary Coffee

### Specialty Revolution

| Development | Impact |
|-------------|--------|
| Starbucks (1971) | Coffeehouse chain model |
| Third wave | Origin, roast, brewing method focus |
| Direct trade | Bypass commodity markets |
| Premium prices | For quality differentiation |

### Fair Trade

| Feature | Debate |
|---------|--------|
| Minimum price | $1.40/lb floor |
| Cooperative requirement | Organization needed |
| Premium | For community development |
| Scale | ~5% of market |
| Critique | Leakage, certification costs |

### Supply Chain

| Stage | Value Capture |
|-------|---------------|
| Farmer | 5-10% of retail price |
| Exporter | 5% |
| Importer | 5% |
| Roaster | 35% |
| Retailer | 45% |

### Climate Change Threat

| Risk | Consequence |
|------|-------------|
| Temperature rise | Suitable area shrinking |
| Altitude shift | Moving uphill |
| Pests | Coffee rust spreading |
| Water | Drought stress |
| Forecast | 50% area loss by 2050? |

## Coffee and Development

### What Coffee Did

| Effect | Positive/Negative |
|--------|-------------------|
| Export revenue | Positive: foreign exchange |
| Infrastructure | Positive: railways, ports |
| Labor systems | Negative: coercion, exploitation |
| Land concentration | Negative: inequality |
| Political power | Negative: oligarchy |
| Dependency | Negative: price volatility |

### Why Coffee Didn't Develop Countries

| Barrier | Mechanism |
|---------|-----------|
| Value capture | Most value added in consuming countries |
| Commodity trap | Price-taker, no differentiation |
| Institutional weakness | Oligarchies blocked reform |
| Dutch disease | Coffee crowded out other sectors |

### Exceptions

| Country | Outcome |
|---------|---------|
| Costa Rica | Higher development, smaller farms |
| Colombia | Better institutions, federation |
| Contrast | Guatemala, El Salvador—oligarchy, conflict |

## The Deeper Point

Coffee shows how a single commodity can shape [[Institutions and Progress|institutions]]—plantation labor systems, oligarchic politics, export dependence all followed from the crop's economics. The plant's characteristics (labor-intensive, perennial, processing required) created incentives for large estates. Large estates created landed oligarchies. Oligarchies controlled states. States maintained coercive labor systems.

The variation is instructive: Costa Rica's smallholder pattern produced more democratic institutions. Colombia's federation provided collective action for small farmers. Brazil's fazendas created an oligarchy but one that eventually supported industrialization. Guatemala's finca system created a military-oligarch alliance that resisted all reform.

Coffee's lesson for [[Development Economics|development]] is that commodity production creates institutional templates. The plantation template—concentrated land, coerced labor, export orientation—persisted long after coffee's dominance faded. Countries that escaped the template (Costa Rica, Colombia to some extent) developed better; those that didn't (Guatemala, El Salvador) suffered decades of conflict.

The contemporary coffee economy continues to reflect these patterns: farmers capture 5-10% of value while consuming-country companies capture the rest. Fair trade and specialty markets offer partial solutions, but the structural inequality of the coffee chain—tropical production, temperate consumption—remains. Climate change now threatens even this arrangement, potentially displacing millions of farmers as suitable growing areas shrink.
