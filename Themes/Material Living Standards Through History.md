# Material Living Standards Through History

What did "rich" and "poor" actually mean? For most of history, even the wealthy lived without indoor plumbing, reliable heat, or abundant food. The average Roman emperor couldn't have antibiotics; the richest medieval king couldn't have electric light. Living standards are the ultimate test of economic institutions—did they enable human flourishing? The data reveals a dramatic story: millennia of near-stagnation, then explosive growth since industrialization that has transformed what "normal" life means.

## Overview

| Era | Character |
|-----|-----------|
| Pre-industrial | Near-subsistence for most |
| Industrial transition | Worsening, then improvement |
| Modern | Unprecedented prosperity |
| Global variation | Enormous gaps persist |

## Ancient Living Standards

### Ordinary Life

| Aspect | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| Housing | One room, shared with animals (rural) |
| Diet | Grain-based, little meat or variety |
| Clothing | Few garments, repaired repeatedly |
| Work | Dawn to dusk, seasonal |
| Life expectancy | ~25-30 years |

### Social Hierarchy

| Class | Living standard |
|-------|-----------------|
| Elite | Comfortable by pre-modern standards |
| Urban workers | Better than rural |
| Peasants | Subsistence |
| Slaves | Bare survival |

### What Wealth Meant

| Rich had | Poor lacked |
|----------|-------------|
| Variety of food | Often hungry |
| Multiple rooms | Crowded |
| Servants | Did own labor |
| Travel | Stayed local |
| Leisure | Constant work |

## Medieval Living Standards

### Peasant Life

| Aspect | Character |
|--------|-----------|
| Diet | Bread, pottage, ale, occasional meat |
| Housing | One-room cottage, thatched |
| Work | Field labor, crafts at home |
| Calories | 2,000-3,000/day when adequate |
| Risk | Famine when harvests failed |

### Urban Workers

| Advantage | Over peasants |
|-----------|---------------|
| Higher wages | Especially skilled |
| Better diet | More variety |
| Freedom | From manorial bonds |
| Risk | Disease, unemployment |

### Post-[[Black Death]]

| Change | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Wages | Rose 50-100% |
| Diet | More meat, better |
| Land | More available |
| Serfdom | Declined (West) |
| Duration | Improved for generations |

## Early Modern Living Standards

### Regional Variation

| Region | Character |
|--------|-----------|
| Netherlands | Highest living standards |
| England | Rising, especially after 1600 |
| Mediterranean | Stagnant or declining |
| Eastern Europe | Declining (second serfdom) |

### Dutch Golden Age

| Aspect | Character |
|--------|-----------|
| Diet | Abundant, varied |
| Housing | Comfortable, clean |
| Consumption | Paintings, china, furniture |
| Leisure | More than elsewhere |

### Pre-Industrial Ceiling

| Constraint | Effect |
|------------|--------|
| Agricultural productivity | Limited surplus |
| Energy | Muscle, wood, water, wind |
| Technology | Pre-mechanical |
| Growth | Slow or cyclical |

## Industrial Revolution Impact

### Initial Deterioration

| Aspect | Change |
|--------|--------|
| Urban conditions | Crowded, polluted |
| Work hours | Increased |
| Child labor | Factory employment |
| Life expectancy | Initially fell in cities |
| Wages | Debated—probably stagnant 1760-1820 |

### The Pessimist Case

| Evidence | Interpretation |
|----------|----------------|
| Height decline | Nutritional stress |
| Urban mortality | Disease, pollution |
| Working hours | 60-80 hours/week |
| Qualitative accounts | Harsh conditions |

### The Optimist Case

| Evidence | Interpretation |
|----------|----------------|
| Consumption goods | More affordable |
| Eventually | Wages rose 1820+ |
| Options | Factory vs. rural poverty |
| Long run | Undeniable improvement |

### Improvement Phase (1850+)

| Change | Timing |
|--------|--------|
| Real wages | Rising from 1820s |
| Working hours | Declining from 1850s |
| Life expectancy | Rising from 1870s |
| Consumption | Mass goods affordable |
| Urban conditions | Sanitation, water improved |

## The Great Enrichment

### What Changed

| Measure | 1800 | 2000 |
|---------|------|------|
| World GDP/capita | ~$1,000 | ~$8,000 |
| Life expectancy | ~30 | ~70 |
| Literacy | ~10% | ~85% |
| Extreme poverty | ~90% | ~10% |
| Work hours (year) | 3,000+ | 1,500-2,000 |

### Material Abundance

| 1800s worker | 2000s worker |
|--------------|--------------|
| Few clothes | Full wardrobe |
| One-room housing | Multiple rooms |
| Walk or cart | Cars, planes |
| Candles | Electric light |
| Seasonal food | Year-round variety |

### What Even the Rich Lacked

| Before 1900 | Now universal (developed world) |
|-------------|--------------------------------|
| Antibiotics | Standard medicine |
| Indoor plumbing | Expected |
| Electric light | Standard |
| Refrigeration | Standard |
| Air travel | Common |
| Global communication | In pocket |

## Global Divergence

### Living Standards Today

| Region | GDP/capita (PPP) |
|--------|------------------|
| Western Europe | $45,000+ |
| United States | $65,000+ |
| East Asia (developed) | $40,000+ |
| Latin America | $10,000-20,000 |
| South Asia | $5,000-10,000 |
| Sub-Saharan Africa | $3,000-5,000 |

### What Poverty Means Today

| Aspect | Extreme poverty |
|--------|-----------------|
| Income | <$2.15/day (2017 PPP) |
| Nutrition | Often inadequate |
| Housing | Informal, crowded |
| Health | Limited access |
| Education | Interrupted or absent |

### Progress

| Measure | 1990 | 2020 |
|---------|------|------|
| Extreme poverty | 36% | 9% |
| Child mortality | 93/1,000 | 37/1,000 |
| Literacy | 76% | 87% |

## The Deeper Point

Living standards are the ultimate measure of [[Institutions and Progress|institutional]] performance—did the rules of the game enable human flourishing? For most of history, the answer was: barely. Even wealthy societies operated near subsistence for most people; elite comfort depended on mass poverty. The [[Industrial Revolution]] initially worsened conditions for many before creating unprecedented abundance. The breakthrough came when institutions channeled [[Innovation Economics|entrepreneurial ambition]] into productivity growth rather than redistribution—when the pie grew faster than elites could extract. The result: a medieval king's material life was worse than a modern minimum-wage worker's. Air conditioning, antibiotics, air travel, abundant food—luxuries unimaginable to any pre-modern person—are now routine. Yet global divergence persists: institutions that enable prosperity in some places fail in others. The question of [[Development Economics|development]] is ultimately whether the institutional package that created the great enrichment can spread to the billions still living in poverty. Living standards reveal that economics is not just about production—it's about whether the gains reach ordinary people.
