# Guilds

Guilds were medieval Europe's characteristic economic institution—associations of merchants or craftsmen that regulated production, prices, quality, and entry into trades. From the 11th century onward, guilds organized urban economic life, providing training, social support, and market control. Whether guilds promoted or hindered economic development remains debated, but their importance for understanding pre-industrial economies is undeniable.
