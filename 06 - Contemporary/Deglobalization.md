# Deglobalization

After four decades of accelerating economic integration, the 2010s saw globalization stall—and the 2020s, partial reversal. Trade as a share of GDP peaked. Supply chains that optimized for cost began optimizing for resilience. The US and China, once partners in globalization, became rivals pursuing decoupling. Whether this represents a temporary adjustment or a fundamental shift remains unclear, but the era of frictionless global integration is over.

## Overview

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Peak globalization | 2007-2008 |
| Stall period | 2008-2016 |
| Active reversal | 2018-present |
| Key drivers | China tensions, COVID, security concerns |
| Contested term | "Slowbalization," fragmentation, decoupling |

### Eras

| Period | Character |
|--------|-----------|

| Export controls | Deny China advanced technology |
| Outbound investment screening | Restrict capital flow to China |

### European Union

| Policy | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| EU Chips Act | €43 billion semiconductor investment |
| Critical Raw Materials Act | Reduce dependency |
| Carbon border adjustment | Protect against carbon dumping |
| Foreign subsidy regulation | Address unfair competition |

### China

| Policy | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| Dual Circulation | Reduce export dependence |

## Trade Reconfigurations

### Friend-shoring

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Definition | Trade within allied countries |
| US approach | Work with democracies, exclude China |
| Limits | Allies may not want to choose sides |
| Examples | IPEF, Quad economic coordination |

### Near-shoring

| Flow | Development |
|------|-------------|
| US-Mexico | Surpassed China as top US trading partner (2023) |
| EU-Eastern Europe | Manufacturing shift |
| Japan-Southeast Asia | China+1 strategy |
| Limits | Still rely on Chinese inputs |

### China+1 Strategy

| Company Action | Destination |
|----------------|-------------|
| Diversify from China | Vietnam, India, Indonesia |
| Not exit China | Maintain presence, reduce concentration |
| Apple | India iPhone production |
| Samsung | Vietnam expansion |

## Sectors Most Affected

### Semiconductors

| Issue | Stakes |
|-------|--------|
| Concentration | TSMC (Taiwan) dominates advanced chips |
| US policy | Deny China advanced manufacturing |
| Investment | $200+ billion in new fabs globally |
| Timeline | 5-10 years to change supply structure |

### Electric Vehicles

| Tension | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| China dominance | 60% of EV production, 75% of batteries |
| US IRA | Tax credits require North American content |
| EU response | Anti-subsidy investigations |
| Effect | Bifurcating supply chains |

### Pharmaceuticals

| Concern | Reality |
|---------|---------|
| API dependence | 80% of US APIs from China/India |
| COVID lesson | PPE, drug shortages |

### Re-globalization

## The Deeper Point

Globalization was never just economics—it was a political project that assumed interdependence would create peace and prosperity. The project succeeded on growth (hundreds of millions lifted from poverty) but created political losers (deindustrialized workers) and security vulnerabilities (concentrated supply chains). [[Great Divergence\|The Great Divergence]] was partly reversed: China and Asia caught up by joining global supply chains. Now the question is whether the system that enabled catch-up can survive the arrival of a peer competitor. The deglobalization impulse reflects a rediscovery of [[State Capacity\|state]] concerns that [[Capitalism\|market]] efficiency had overridden: security, resilience, distributional fairness. The historical pattern—[[Trade Networks]] expanding until disrupted by war or politics—suggests integration is never permanent. But the interconnection achieved by 2020 was unprecedented; unwinding it, if that's the goal, will take decades and cost trillions.
