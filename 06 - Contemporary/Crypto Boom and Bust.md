# Crypto Boom and Bust

Cryptocurrency emerged from the 2008 financial crisis as an alternative to traditional finance—decentralized, trustless, beyond government control. By 2021, the market reached $3 trillion and crypto had become a cultural phenomenon. Then it collapsed: prices fell 75%, exchanges failed, fraud was revealed, and regulatory crackdowns followed. The story combines genuine technological innovation, speculative mania, libertarian ideology, and old-fashioned financial fraud—all enabled by the [[ZIRP Era\|easy money]] environment that Bitcoin was supposedly designed to escape.

## The Deeper Point

Crypto reveals the enduring appeal of monetary alternatives and the recurring pattern of [[Speculative Bubbles\|speculative manias]]. Bitcoin emerged from legitimate distrust of banks after 2008—the genesis block references a bank bailout headline. But the movement that followed recapitulated financial history's worst impulses: fraud, manipulation, Ponzi schemes, and retail investors destroyed by professionals. The [[ZIRP Era\|zero-rate environment]] that crypto critics blamed for fiat currency's problems was the same environment that funded crypto's boom—venture capital flooded in because returns were unavailable elsewhere. The technical innovation (blockchain, smart contracts) may prove valuable; the speculative frenzy around tokens probably won't. The deeper lesson connects to [[Money History]]: societies repeatedly seek monetary alternatives when they distrust existing money, and these alternatives repeatedly attract fraud and speculation. Crypto is the digital iteration of this ancient pattern.
