# Contemporary Period

This folder is reserved for notes on the contemporary period (post-2000).

## Scope Note

The vault's primary focus is historical economic development through approximately 2020. Notes on very recent developments (cryptocurrency, COVID-19 economic effects, post-2020 trends) would belong here but are not the vault's current emphasis.

Most "contemporary" economic topics are covered in:
- **05 - Modern/** — 20th century through present
- **Themes/** — Cross-cutting topics that include contemporary applications
