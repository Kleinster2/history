# Climate Economics

Climate change presents the defining economic challenge of the 21st century: transforming a global energy system built over two centuries while maintaining prosperity. The economics involve massive externalities (emissions), coordination problems (global commons), transition costs (stranded assets), and distributional conflicts (who pays). Progress has accelerated—renewable costs collapsed, EVs went mainstream, climate policy spread—but the gap between current trajectories and climate targets remains vast.

## Overview

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Core problem | CO2 as externality |
| Scale | $100+ trillion energy system |
| Timeline | Net zero by 2050 (targets) |
| Tools | Carbon pricing, subsidies, regulation |
| Status | Accelerating but insufficient |

## The Economic Problem

### Externalities

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Negative externality | Emissions cost borne by others |
| Market failure | Prices don't reflect true costs |
| Solution | Make polluters pay (carbon price) |
| Challenge | Global coordination required |

### The Carbon Budget

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Remaining budget (1.5°C) | ~300 billion tons CO2 |
| Annual emissions | ~40 billion tons |
| Years at current rate | ~7 years |
| Implication | Rapid decarbonization required |

### Damage Estimates

| Study | Damage per Ton CO2 |
|-------|-------------------|
| EPA (2023) | $190 |
| Stern Review | $85 |
| Nordhaus | $31 |
| Range reflects | Discount rate, damage assumptions |

---

## Carbon Pricing

### Theory

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Pigouvian tax | Price equals social cost |
| Cap and trade | Set quantity, let price emerge |
| Effect | Incentivize alternatives |
| Revenue | Can be recycled to citizens |

### Implementation

| System | Coverage | Price (2024) |
|--------|----------|--------------|
| EU ETS | 40% of EU emissions | ~€80/ton |
| California | 80% of state emissions | ~$35/ton |
| China ETS | Power sector | ~$10/ton |
| Canada | Federal backstop | C$80/ton |

### Effectiveness

| Strength | Weakness |
|----------|----------|
| Efficient allocation | Political resistance |
| Revenue generation | Can be too low |
| Clear signal | Leakage to non-covered areas |
| Proven to reduce emissions | Doesn't solve all barriers |

## The Energy Transition

### Cost Declines

| Technology | Cost Decline (2010-2023) |
|------------|-------------------------|
| Solar PV | -90% |
| Onshore wind | -70% |
| Lithium-ion batteries | -90% |
| Result | Renewables cheapest new power in most places |

### Deployment

| Metric | 2010 | 2023 |
|--------|------|------|
| Global solar capacity | 40 GW | 1,200+ GW |
| Global wind capacity | 200 GW | 900+ GW |
| EV sales | 0.01 million | 14 million |
| Share of new car sales (EV) | 0% | 18% |

### Investment

| Flow | 2023 |
|------|------|
| Clean energy investment | $1.8 trillion |
| Fossil fuel investment | $1.0 trillion |
| Ratio shift | First year clean > fossil |
| Required (IEA Net Zero) | $4 trillion/year by 2030 |

## Stranded Assets

### The Problem

| Asset Type | Stranding Risk |
|------------|----------------|
| Coal plants | High (many closing early) |
| Oil reserves | Depends on transition speed |
| Gas infrastructure | Medium (bridge fuel debate) |
| Petrostates | Entire economies at risk |

### Estimates

| Source | Stranded Asset Value |
|--------|---------------------|
| Carbon Tracker | $1-4 trillion in fossil reserves |
| Divestment movement | ~$40 trillion committed |
| Write-downs | Already appearing on balance sheets |

### Who Loses

| Loser | Exposure |
|-------|----------|
| Coal companies | Existential |
| Oil majors | Significant but diversifying |
| Petrostates | GDP dependent on exports |
| Workers | Regional job losses |
| Pension funds | Fossil fuel holdings |

---

## Policy Approaches

### Subsidies (IRA Model)

| Feature | US Inflation Reduction Act |
|---------|---------------------------|
| Approach | Subsidize clean, don't tax dirty |
| Scale | $370+ billion in incentives |
| Politics | Passed with 50 votes |
| Effect | Manufacturing reshoring |

### Regulation (EU Model)

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| ETS | Cap and trade |
| Standards | Vehicle emissions, efficiency |
| Bans | ICE vehicle phase-out |
| Disclosure | Climate risk reporting |
| CBAM | Carbon border adjustment |

### Comparison

| IRA Approach | EU Approach |
|--------------|-------------|
| Carrots | Sticks and carrots |
| Politically easier | More comprehensive |
| Deficit-financed | Revenue-neutral possible |
| Industry-friendly | Higher compliance costs |

## Distributional Issues

### Global

| Issue | Tension |
|-------|---------|
| Historical emissions | Rich countries caused problem |
| Current emissions | China now largest emitter |
| Development rights | Poor countries want to grow |
| Climate finance | $100 billion/year pledged, not delivered |
| Loss and damage | Compensation for climate harms |

### Domestic

| Issue | Tension |
|-------|---------|
| Carbon tax incidence | Regressive without recycling |
| Job losses | Concentrated in certain regions |
| Energy costs | Poor spend higher share of income |
| Asset losses | Workers vs. shareholders |
| Rural vs. urban | Different transportation needs |

### Just Transition

| Net costs | Transition is expensive |
| Growth trade-off | Climate policy reduces GDP |
| Competitiveness | Unilateral action disadvantages |

## The Deeper Point

Climate economics forces a confrontation between the time horizons of markets and of physics. Markets discount the future heavily—a dollar in 30 years is worth little today—but atmospheric CO2 accumulates regardless of discount rates. The fundamental debate is about intergenerational equity: how much should current generations sacrifice for future ones? [[Economic Thought\|Economists]] differ radically on this (Nordhaus vs. Stern), and the answer is ultimately ethical, not technical. The [[Energy Transitions\|energy transition]] is historically unprecedented in speed required, though not in direction—every previous transition (wood→coal→oil→gas) took decades and was driven by cost advantages, not policy. The optimistic view: renewable cost declines now provide the economic driver that policy alone couldn't. The pessimistic view: vested interests, coordination failures, and the sheer scale of the fossil fuel system make rapid transition impossible. The realistic view: some level of dangerous warming is now inevitable; the economic question is how bad, and how to adapt.
