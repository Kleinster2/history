# Tech Industry Reckoning

The tech industry's 2022-2024 contraction marked the end of an era. After a decade of seemingly unlimited capital, soaring valuations, and growth at all costs, rising interest rates exposed the business models that only worked when money was free. Mass layoffs hit every major tech company. Startup valuations collapsed. The pivot to AI offered a new narrative, but the underlying shift was permanent: the [[ZIRP Era]] rules no longer applied.

## Overview

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Trigger | Interest rate increases, 2022 |
| Peak layoffs | Late 2022 - early 2023 |
| Scale | 400,000+ tech workers laid off |
| Pivot | AI becomes new focus |
| Status | Restructured, not collapsed |

## The ZIRP Tech Model

### How Cheap Capital Shaped Tech

| Feature | ZIRP-Era Logic |
|---------|----------------|
| Growth over profit | Future market share valued more than current earnings |
| Blitzscaling | Spend to dominate before competitors |
| Negative unit economics | Lose money on each transaction to gain users |
| High valuations | Low discount rates inflated future earnings |
| Employee perks | Compete for talent with lavish benefits |

### The Numbers

| Metric | 2010 | 2021 (Peak) |
|--------|------|-------------|
| Global VC investment | $50 billion | $620 billion |
| Unicorn count | ~40 | 1,000+ |
| FAANG market cap | $500 billion | $9 trillion |
| Tech IPO proceeds | $15 billion | $150 billion |

### Exemplary ZIRP Companies

| Company | Model |
|---------|-------|
| Uber | Subsidize rides to eliminate competitors |
| WeWork | Lease cheap, sublease expensive, burn cash |
| DoorDash | Lose money on every delivery |
| Peloton | Hardware subsidized by subscription hopes |
| Zoom | Free tier acquires, enterprise converts |

## The Deeper Point

The tech reckoning reveals how [[ZIRP Era\|interest rates]] shaped an entire industry's development. When capital is free, companies can pursue growth indefinitely without proving sustainable economics. When capital has a cost, the question becomes: does this business actually make money? Many ZIRP-era companies were essentially burning investor capital to subsidize consumer services—a transfer from VCs to users that couldn't continue forever. The AI pivot offers a genuine technological breakthrough, but also follows the familiar pattern: a new narrative to justify continued investment. The deeper question is whether [[Innovation Economics\|tech innovation]] has genuinely slowed (fewer transformative products, more iteration) or whether the reckoning simply reveals that much "innovation" was actually subsidized service provision. [[Creative Destruction]] is working as Schumpeter described: excess capacity is being destroyed, resources are reallocating to new uses. The survivors will be leaner, more disciplined, and possibly less innovative—or the AI wave will restart the cycle.
