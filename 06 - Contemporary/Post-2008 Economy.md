# Post-2008 Economy

The 2008 financial crisis was the most severe economic shock since the [[Great Depression]]. A housing bubble, securitization of bad mortgages, and excessive leverage brought the global financial system to the edge of collapse. The response—bailouts, stimulus, and [[ZIRP Era|zero interest rates]]—prevented depression but shaped a decade of slow recovery, rising inequality, and political backlash. The crisis discredited pre-2008 orthodoxy about efficient markets and light-touch regulation, but the new consensus remains contested.

## Overview

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Trigger | US housing bubble collapse |
| Peak crisis | September-October 2008 |

## The Deeper Point

The post-2008 economy demonstrates how [[Economic Collapse|financial crises]] reshape the social contract. The bailouts worked technically—they prevented systemic collapse and were mostly repaid. But they failed politically—the perception that elites were rescued while ordinary people suffered fueled a decade of populist anger. The slow recovery wasn't inevitable; it reflected choices: fiscal austerity in Europe, stimulus withdrawal in the US, prioritizing bank balance sheets over household ones. The [[Inequality]] that followed wasn't an accident but a policy outcome. [[ZIRP Era|Zero interest rates]] inflated assets held by the wealthy while wages stagnated. The crisis also revealed the limits of [[Central Banking]]: monetary policy kept the system functioning but couldn't restore growth alone. The deepest lesson may be about [[Institutions and Progress|institutional]] legitimacy—efficient crisis response isn't enough if it violates popular notions of fairness. The political consequences of 2008 are still unfolding.
