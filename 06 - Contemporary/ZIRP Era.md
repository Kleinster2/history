# ZIRP Era

Zero Interest Rate Policy (ZIRP) defined the post-2008 global economy. Central banks pushed rates to zero—and in Europe, negative—to stimulate recovery from the financial crisis. For fourteen years, the cost of capital collapsed. The consequences reshaped everything: asset prices soared, tech startups raised billions without profits, housing became unaffordable for a generation, and corporate debt exploded. When inflation finally forced rates up in 2022, the ZIRP era ended, revealing what cheap money had built and what it had distorted.

## Debates

### Was ZIRP Necessary?

| Position | Argument |

| Yes | Prevented depression, deflation |
| No | Created asset bubbles, inequality |
| Partially | Needed initially, held too long |

| Yes | Asset inflation benefited wealthy |
| No | Employment gains helped workers |
| Complex | Both effects present |

### How Long Was Too Long?

| Perspective | View |
|-------------|------|
| Hawks | Should have normalized by 2012 |
| Doves | Inflation was the signal to stop |
| Pragmatists | 2015-2018 normalization was right, COVID reset necessary |

## The Deeper Point

ZIRP reveals a fundamental tension in [[Central Banking]]: the same policy that prevents immediate crisis can create future instability. Low rates in 2008 prevented depression; low rates for fourteen years inflated every asset class, made housing unaffordable, and financed business models that only worked with free money. The [[Capitalism\|capitalist]] system's price signals were distorted at the most fundamental level—the price of capital itself. When rates rose, the malinvestment revealed itself: [[Crypto Boom and Bust\|crypto]], unprofitable tech, office buildings no one used. But the deeper question is whether the alternative—tight money and prolonged unemployment—would have been better. The ZIRP era was an unprecedented experiment in monetary policy whose full consequences remain unclear. What's certain: a generation's economic experience was shaped by the assumption that money was essentially free.
