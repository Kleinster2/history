# Hugo Grotius

Hugo Grotius (Hugo de Groot) was a Dutch jurist, philosopher, and theologian generally credited as the founder of international law. His 1609 treatise *Mare Liberum* ("Freedom of the Seas") is held up as the foundation of the rules-based international order. The standard account presents Grotius as an idealist theorist of just war, free trade, and the peaceful resolution of disputes. The actual context: *Mare Liberum* was a legal justification for an act of piracy commissioned by the [[Dutch Golden Age|Dutch East India Company]].

## The Santa Catarina Incident

The event that produced modern international law:

| Element | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| Date | 1603 |
| What happened | Dutch forces captured the Portuguese spice ship *Santa Catarina* in the Straits of Singapore |
| Method | Blasted the ship apart |
| Cargo value | Approximately half the total stock value of the VOC |
| Scale | One of the largest acts of piracy in history |
| Problem | The Dutch needed a legal justification for keeping the cargo |
| Solution | Employed Grotius—a brilliant young lawyer—to write one |

## *Mare Liberum* (1609)

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Title | "The Freedom of the Seas" |
| Published | 1609 (initially anonymously) |
| Original context | Part of a larger unpublished treatise (*De Jure Praedae* — "On the Law of Prize") |
| Argument | The seas are open to all nations for trade; no nation can claim monopoly over ocean routes |
| Target | Portuguese monopoly on Indian Ocean trade |
| Actual purpose | Legal defense of the *Santa Catarina* seizure |
| Irony | A defense of piracy became the foundation of the "rules-based international order" |

### What It Argued

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Freedom of navigation | No nation can own the oceans |
| Free trade | Trade should not be monopolized |
| Just war | Use of force is permissible to defend natural rights, including the right to trade |
| Natural law | These principles derive from reason, not sovereign authority |

### What It Really Did

| Claim | Reality |
|-------|---------|
| Argued for free trade | The VOC immediately imposed its own monopoly once it gained power |
| Argued against Portuguese monopoly | Replaced it with a Dutch monopoly enforced by greater violence |
| Defended freedom of the seas | The Dutch controlled every major choke point in the Indian Ocean |
| Laid foundations for international law | Based on justifying a specific act of robbery on the high seas |

## *De Jure Belli ac Pacis* (1625)

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Title | "On the Law of War and Peace" |
| Published | 1625 |
| Scope | Comprehensive theory of just war, natural law, and international relations |
| Influence | Foundation of what theorists call the "Grotian tradition" |

### The Grotian Tradition

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Rules-based order | International relations governed by general principles, not the whim of rulers |
| Idealism vs. realism | Alternative to the Hobbesian view that international relations is pure power politics |
| Institutions | Nations subscribe to shared rules about war, peace, and trade |
| Modern legacy | United Nations, World Trade Organization, international humanitarian law |

## The Deeper History

[[David Wengrow]] argues that the entire framework of international law has never looked legitimate to more than half the world, which was perfectly conscious that the system was stacked against them from the beginning.

| Observation | Detail |
|-------------|--------|
| Pre-existing Indian Ocean trade | Sophisticated maritime civilizations with joint-stock ventures, weights and measures, law codes for cargo |
| What they lacked | Gunships |
| Portuguese contribution | Destroyed these civilizations by force |
| Dutch contribution | Replaced Portuguese monopoly with their own, using Grotius to give it a legal framework |
| The result | "International law" emerged from the interests of the most violent actors |

### Wengrow's New Book

Grotius is the starting point of Wengrow's forthcoming book on the Indian Ocean and the three freedoms. The book traces how the European encounter with the Indian Ocean produced the intellectual foundations of the modern global order—and how the same body of water contains materials for a completely different understanding of human freedoms.
