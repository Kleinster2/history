# David Wengrow

David Wengrow is a British archaeologist and Professor of Comparative Archaeology at University College London. His work challenges conventional narratives about the origins of inequality, hierarchy, and the state. Where most economic histories assume a linear trajectory from simple to complex societies, Wengrow—especially in collaboration with David Graeber—argues that early humans were far more politically diverse and experimental than the standard model allows, and that the path to modern institutions was neither inevitable nor one-directional.

## Overview

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Born | 1972 |
| Field | Comparative archaeology, prehistory |
| Institution | University College London |
| Key collaboration | David Graeber (1961-2020) |
| Key work | *[[The Dawn of Everything]]* (2021, with Graeber) |
| Core argument | Early societies consciously chose diverse political and economic arrangements |

## The Discipline's Roots

Wengrow is outspoken about the racist foundations of his own field. He traces the claim that Africans could not have built the pyramids back to the discipline's founding figures—particularly William Matthew Flinders Petrie, the so-called father of archaeological science. Petrie was a eugenicist who attributed Egyptian civilization to a "new race" migrating from western Asia, explicitly denying African origins. Petrie's classifications—and the related "Hamitic hypothesis"—fed directly into modern ethnic categories, including those that fueled the Rwandan genocide.

Wengrow argues that by creating this initial division—"it couldn't possibly have been Africans"—Petri opened a window into which anything could be inserted: a master race, alien builders, whatever. The structure is mythical, not factual, and cannot be refuted by correcting details—only by confronting the premise.

### Indo-Europeans and the Return of Race Science

Wengrow is critical of how legitimate historical linguistics (the real connections among languages from Iran to Ireland) has been hijacked to reconstruct links between language, culture, and biological race. He notes that the Nazis appropriated Indo-European studies in the mid-20th century, and that recent ancient DNA research has reintroduced similar frameworks—a 2024 paper in a top science journal was titled "The Genetic Origins of the Proto-Indo-Europeans." Wengrow sees this as normalizing the idea that culture, language, and biology form a unity, producing migration maps that closely resemble early 20th-century racial categories.

## Key Ideas

### Against the Standard Narrative

The conventional story of human social evolution runs: small bands → tribes → chiefdoms → states. Wengrow rejects this as a modern myth with no basis in the archaeological record.

| Standard Model | Wengrow's Counter |
|----------------|-------------------|
| Linear progression | Multiple paths, reversals, experiments |
| Agriculture → hierarchy | Some farming societies rejected hierarchy |
| Scale requires states | Large populations organized without centralized authority |
| Inequality is recent | Seasonal inequality existed very early |
| Hunter-gatherers were simple | Complex political arrangements, monumental architecture |

### Seasonal Variation

One of Wengrow's most striking arguments: many early societies deliberately shifted between political arrangements depending on the season.

| Season | Organization | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| Summer | Dispersed, egalitarian bands | Plains groups during hunt dispersal |
| Winter | Aggregated, hierarchical, with chiefs | Same groups during ceremonial gatherings |

This means early people understood hierarchy and consciously chose when to adopt it—and when to reject it.

### "Schismogenesis"

Borrowed from Gregory Bateson, this concept is central to Wengrow and Graeber's argument:

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Definition | Societies define themselves in opposition to neighbors |
| Mechanism | If neighbors are hierarchical, we are egalitarian (and vice versa) |
| Implication | Political organization is a conscious choice, not an evolutionary stage |
| Example | Northwest Coast vs. California indigenous groups |

### The "Indigenous Critique"

| Argument | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Claim | Indigenous North Americans critiqued European inequality |
| Key figure | Kandiaronk (Wendat leader, 1649-1701) |
| Impact | Influenced Enlightenment thinkers (Lahontan → Rousseau) |
| Implication | Western notions of freedom and equality partly originated from indigenous thought |

### Capitalism as Empire

Wengrow rejects the narrative that capitalism spread through free markets and free trade. The Portuguese and Dutch destroyed existing free-trading civilizations in the Indian Ocean and replaced them with monopolies enforced by gunships. The [[Dutch Golden Age]] was funded not by open markets but by the VOC's violent monopolization of the spice trade. The key European innovation in Asian maritime commerce was not financial—it was putting cannons on ships.

## David Graeber

Wengrow's intellectual partnership with the anthropologist David Graeber (1961-2020) was central to his work. They spent ten years writing *[[The Dawn of Everything]]* together. Graeber died suddenly before the book was published. Wengrow describes the collaboration as a form of intellectual intimacy—"you kind of rent out part of your brain to them"—and has spoken openly about the difficulty of continuing alone. Graeber had envisioned the book as the first of a trilogy (he called it "The Hobbit" before "The Lord of the Rings").

Graeber's early fieldwork in the central highlands of Madagascar focused on trauma and memory—a dimension of his work that Wengrow only fully engaged with after his death, and which has shaped the direction of Wengrow's new research.

## Major Works

| Work | Year | Contribution |
|------|------|--------------|
| *What Makes Civilization?* | 2010 | Cross-cultural comparison of early Egypt and Mesopotamia |
| *The Dawn of Everything* | 2021 | Comprehensive rewriting of human social history (with Graeber) |
| New book (in progress) | Forthcoming | Indian Ocean, international law origins, and the three freedoms |
| Academic articles | Ongoing | Archaeology of the Near East, comparative approaches |

### Current Project

Wengrow is writing a new book that follows a similar structure to *The Dawn of Everything* but focuses on the Indian Ocean. It begins with [[Hugo Grotius]] and the origins of international law—the *Mare Liberum* (1609), which was actually a legal justification for Dutch piracy against a Portuguese spice ship. The book then explores how the same body of water contains materials for a completely different understanding of human freedoms. It connects to Graeber's Madagascar fieldwork (the original Malagasy population traces linguistically and genetically to Borneo) and develops the three freedoms framework—to move, to disobey, to create—through new historical and archaeological examples.

## Relevance to Economic History

### What Wengrow Challenges

| Assumption | His Counter |
|------------|-------------|
| Surplus → hierarchy → state → markets | Sequence was not universal or inevitable |
| Agriculture was a trap or a leap | Adopted and abandoned multiple times in some regions |
| Property rights evolved linearly | Different property regimes coexisted |
| Economic complexity requires the state | [[Göbekli Tepe]], Poverty Point, Ukrainian mega-sites had complexity without states |

### What This Means for the Vault

Wengrow's work is a corrective to teleological accounts of progress. The vault traces how humanity went from subsistence to modernity, but Wengrow shows that this path involved far more deliberate choice—and far more reversals—than a simple progress narrative suggests. The question shifts from "how did complexity inevitably emerge?" to "why did some societies choose complexity and others reject it?"

| Vault Theme | Wengrow's Contribution |
|-------------|------------------------|
| [[Institutions and Progress]] | Institutions were chosen, not evolved |
| [[Rise of Civilization]] | Civilization wasn't a stage—many forms existed |
| [[Agricultural Revolution]] | Agriculture wasn't a one-way door everywhere |
| [[State Formation]] | States are one solution among many |
| [[Origins of Economy]] | Economic diversity predates civilization |

### The Disagreement

Wengrow's framework sits in tension with institutional economists like [[Douglass North]] and Acemoglu & Robinson ([[Why Nations Fail]]), who treat the emergence of inclusive institutions as the key explanatory variable. For Wengrow, the question isn't which institutions emerged, but why certain societies chose particular arrangements—and why modern observers assume the path was inevitable.
