# George Herbert Walker

George Herbert Walker was the St. Louis dry goods heir who became a Wall Street power broker and, through his daughter's marriage, the patriarch of a presidential dynasty. As a partner at Harriman Brothers and then Brown Brothers Harriman, he specialized in bold investment deals—railroads, shipping, entertainment. But his most consequential transaction was introducing his daughter Dorothy to Prescott Bush, creating the family alliance that would produce two American presidents. Walker embodied the early 20th-century pattern whereby Midwestern fortunes sought Eastern establishment legitimacy, and banking partnerships cemented social position across generations.

## The Deeper Point

George Herbert Walker represents the machinery of American establishment formation in the early 20th century. A Catholic from St. Louis—double outsider status—he used wealth, athletics, and shrewd alliance-building to place his family at the center of Eastern elite networks. The Walker Cup bought sporting legitimacy. The Harriman partnership bought financial legitimacy. His daughter's marriage to Prescott Bush bought social legitimacy and, eventually, political power beyond anything Walker himself achieved.

The Bush dynasty is often traced to Prescott Bush's Senate career or George H.W. Bush's rise through government. But the foundation was Walker's: he provided the capital, the connections, the Wall Street partnership, and the Maine compound that became Bush family identity. When George Herbert Walker Bush was named for his grandfather, it acknowledged where the family's establishment credentials actually originated.

Walker also illustrates how the line between legitimate finance and problematic entanglement blurred in the interwar period. His German investments through Union Banking Corporation were legal when made, standard practice for American financiers seeking returns in Weimar Germany. That they later connected to Nazi industrialists reflects how international finance operated before the categories hardened. The 1942 seizure was embarrassing but not career-ending—the establishment protected its own, and Walker remained a BBH partner until death.

The dynasty Walker founded would shape American politics for seven decades: one senator, two presidents, two governors, and counting. Not bad for a dry goods merchant's son from Missouri who was good at boxing and loved golf.
