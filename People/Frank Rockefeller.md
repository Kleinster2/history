# Frank Rockefeller

Franklin "Frank" Rockefeller was the brother who said no—to Standard Oil, to John D., to the dynasty itself. The youngest of the Rockefeller brothers, Frank fought in the Civil War, married the daughter of one of John D.'s competitors, co-founded a rival oil company, testified against Standard Oil in court, and called his brother "a monster merciless in greed." When John D. erected an obelisk on the family cemetery plot, Frank had his children's caskets moved to another section: "Not one of my blood will ever rest upon land controlled by that monster." He died unreconciled, buried outside the family plot. Yet Frank's Ohio businesses—including Buckeye Steel Castings, where [[Samuel Bush]] served as general manager and then president—connected him to the industrial networks that would produce the Bush political dynasty.

## The Deeper Point

Frank Rockefeller represents the path not taken—what happened to someone inside the Rockefeller orbit who refused to submit. His brothers built the greatest fortune in American history; Frank called them monsters and testified against them in court. Whether this was principled resistance to monopoly capitalism or bitter inability to match his brothers' success depends on interpretation. Probably both.

The irony is that Frank's marginal businesses mattered more for American history than he could have known. Buckeye Steel Castings was a modest company compared to Standard Oil—railroad equipment instead of refined petroleum. But by hiring [[Samuel Bush]] to run it, Frank set in motion a chain that led to two presidencies. The estranged Rockefeller brother, buried outside the family plot, inadvertently launched the Bush dynasty.

The family dynamics illuminate how Gilded Age fortunes created and destroyed relationships simultaneously. John D. absorbed competitors, including Frank's father-in-law. He took stock from Frank's partner at a price that soon looked like theft. He built an empire; Frank felt crushed by it. The same ruthlessness that created Standard Oil created permanent family rupture. When Frank moved his children's caskets rather than share ground with John D., he was choosing death over reconciliation.

Yet the money kept flowing. Despite the estrangement, John D. and William reportedly helped Frank through repeated financial difficulties. The Rockefeller fortune was large enough to sustain even the brother who denounced it. Frank lived comfortably on the margins of the dynasty he rejected—a position that let him hire a railroad man named Samuel Bush, whose grandsons would become presidents. History's chains run through unlikely links.
