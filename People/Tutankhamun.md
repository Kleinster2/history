# Tutankhamun

Tutankhamun, the "boy king," ruled Egypt for approximately nine years during the late 18th Dynasty. Though his reign was brief and historically minor, the 1922 discovery of his nearly intact tomb by Howard Carter made him the most famous pharaoh in modern times. The tomb's 5,000+ artifacts provide unparalleled insight into New Kingdom royal material culture and the economics of royal burial.
