# Toumaï (TM 266-01-060-1)

Toumaï is the nickname for the oldest potential hominin ever discovered—a 7-to-6-million-year-old cranium of *Sahelanthropus tchadensis* from Chad. If correctly interpreted as a bipedal hominin, Toumaï represents our species very close to the time of the human-chimpanzee split.

| Species | *Sahelanthropus tchadensis* |
| Age at death | Adult (possibly male) |
| Sex | Debated (possibly male) |
| Geological age | 7-6 million years |
| Discovery date | July 19, 2001 |
| Location | Toros-Menalla, Djurab Desert, Chad |
| Discoverer | Ahounta Djimdoumalbaye |
| Lead researcher | Michel Brunet |
| Nickname meaning | "Hope of life" in Goran language |

## Discovery

### The Expedition

| Detail | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Project | Mission Paléoanthropologique Franco-Tchadienne (MPFT) |
| Leader | Michel Brunet (University of Poitiers) |
| Location | Djurab Desert, northern Chad |
| Previous work | 25 years of searching |

### The Find

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| July 19, 2001 | Ahounta Djimdoumalbaye spots skull |
| 2001-2002 | Additional specimens recovered |
| July 2002 | Published in *Nature* |

### The Finder

| Name | Ahounta Djimdoumalbaye |
|------|------------------------|
| Nationality | Chadian |
| Role | Fossil hunter with MPFT |
| Significance | Found oldest known hominin |

## The Fossils

### TM 266-01-060-1 (The Cranium)

| Preserved | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| Cranium | Nearly complete but distorted |
| Face | Present |
| Base of skull | Preserved |
| Teeth | Upper teeth preserved |
| Mandible | Not associated |

### Other Specimens

Additional finds from the site:

| Specimen | Element |
|----------|---------|
| TM 266-01-447 | Mandible fragment |
| TM 266-02-154 | Mandible |
| TM 292-02-01 | Mandible fragment |
| Various | Isolated teeth, femur (2001, analyzed 2022) |

## Anatomy

### Key Features

| Feature | Observation | Interpretation |
|---------|-------------|----------------|
| Brain size | ~360 cc | Chimpanzee-sized |
| Brow ridge | Massive, continuous | Larger than later hominins |
| Face | Relatively flat | Unusual for age |
| Canines | Small, non-honing | Hominin-like |
| Foramen magnum | Anteriorly positioned | Bipedal posture? |
| Nuchal plane | More horizontal | Bipedal indicator? |

### Bipedalism Evidence

The case for upright posture:

| Evidence | Observation |
|----------|-------------|
| Foramen magnum | Positioned under skull |
| Nuchal plane | Horizontal orientation |
| Implication | Head balanced on vertical spine |

### Controversy

| Criticism | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Distortion | Reconstruction debated |
| No postcranials | Femur discovered 2001, described 2022 |
| Foramen position | Some dispute interpretation |
| Could be ape | Features argued to be hominin |

### 2022 Femur Study

A femur was found in 2001 but not published until 2022:

| Finding | Interpretation |
|---------|----------------|
| Femoral morphology | Debated - some see bipedal features |
| Critics | Argue ape-like features |
| Status | Ongoing controversy |

## Classification

### Is Toumaï a Hominin?

| Argument For | Argument Against |
|--------------|------------------|
| Small canines | Could be female ape |
| Anterior foramen | Distortion effects |
| Flat face | Some apes similar |
| Molar features | Generalized |

### Current Consensus

Most researchers accept *Sahelanthropus* as:
- A hominin (in the human lineage)
- Close to the human-ape split
- Representing the ancestral condition
- Important regardless of exact status

### Alternative Interpretations

| View | Proponent |
|------|-----------|
| Stem hominin | Brunet, many researchers |
| Female ape | Some critics |
| Gorilla ancestor | Minority view |
| Unknown great ape | Possible |

## Context

### Paleoenvironment

| Feature | Evidence |
|---------|----------|
| Habitat | Lake margin, gallery forest |
| Environment | Mosaic - forest and more open |
| Climate | Wetter than today |
| Fauna | Fish, crocodiles, anthracotheres |

### Geographic Significance

| Issue | Significance |
|-------|--------------|
| Location | 2,500 km west of East African sites |
| Implication | Hominins widely distributed early |
| Challenge | Not confined to Rift Valley |

## Significance

### If a Hominin

| Implication | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| Oldest hominin | Pushes back record to ~7 Ma |
| Near split | Close to human-chimp divergence |
| Wide range | Early distribution across Africa |
| Mosaic | Primitive and derived features |

### What Toumaï Represents

| Feature | Interpretation |
|---------|----------------|
| Small brain | Expected for age |
| Small canines | Hominin-like early |
| Flat face | Unexpectedly human-like |
| Massive brow | More than later hominins |

## Comparison

### Toumaï vs. Other Early Hominins

| Feature | Toumaï (7 Ma) | *Ardipithecus* (4.4 Ma) | *Australopithecus* (3 Ma) |
|---------|---------------|-------------------------|---------------------------|
| Brain | ~360 cc | ~350 cc | ~450 cc |
| Canines | Small | Small | Small |
| Brow ridge | Massive | Smaller | Moderate |
| Face | Relatively flat | Projecting | Projecting |
| Age | Oldest | Middle | Younger |

## The Name

### Meaning

| Language | Word | Translation |
|----------|------|-------------|
| Goran (Chad) | Toumaï | "Hope of life" |
| Cultural context | Name given to dry-season babies | Born against odds |
| Scientific name | *Sahelanthropus tchadensis* | "Sahel human from Chad" |
