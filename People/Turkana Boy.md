# Turkana Boy (KNM-WT 15000)

Turkana Boy is the most complete early human skeleton ever found—a 1.5-million-year-old juvenile *Homo erectus* (or *H. ergaster*) discovered near Lake Turkana, Kenya in 1984. Standing about 1.6 meters tall at death, he would have reached approximately 1.85 meters as an adult, making him the first hominin with essentially modern body proportions.

## Overview

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Specimen number | KNM-WT 15000 |
| Species | *Homo erectus* / *Homo ergaster* |
| Age at death | 8-11 years (estimates vary) |
| Sex | Male |
| Geological age | 1.5-1.6 million years |
| Discovery date | August 1984 |
| Location | Nariokotome III, west Lake Turkana, Kenya |
| Discoverer | Kamoya Kimeu |
| Current location | National Museums of Kenya, Nairobi |

## Discovery

### Kamoya Kimeu

The discoverer was Kamoya Kimeu, legendary Kenyan fossil hunter:

| Detail | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Profession | Chief fossil finder for the Leakeys |
| Career | 60+ years of fossil hunting |
| Other finds | Many important hominins |
| Recognition | John J. Carty Award (1985) |

### The Find

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| August 23, 1984 | Kimeu spots skull fragment |
| Following days | Major excavation begins |
| 1984-1988 | 1,500+ bone fragments recovered |
| Result | ~40% of skeleton recovered |

### Excavation

The excavation was painstaking:
- Sieved tons of sediment
- Recovered over 1,500 fragments
- Many bones reconstructed from pieces
- Root channels had penetrated bones
- Exceptional preservation for East Africa

## The Skeleton

### Completeness

Approximately 40% complete, but remarkably so:

| Preserved Elements | Status |
|-------------------|--------|
| Skull | Nearly complete |
| Mandible | Complete with teeth |
| Vertebral column | Most vertebrae |
| Ribs | Many |
| Pelvis | Both sides, partial |
| Femora | Both, nearly complete |
| Tibiae | Both, partial |
| Humeri | Both |
| Forearm bones | Partial |
| Hands/feet | Some bones |

### What's Missing

- Many hand and foot bones
- Some vertebrae
- Parts of pelvis

## Anatomy

### Size

| Feature | Measurement |
|---------|-------------|
| Height at death | ~1.6 m (5 ft 3 in) |
| Projected adult height | ~1.85 m (6 ft 1 in) |
| Weight at death | ~48 kg (106 lbs) |
| Projected adult weight | ~68 kg (150 lbs) |
| Brain size | 880 cc |
| Projected adult brain | ~910 cc |

### Body Proportions

First hominin with modern body plan:

| Feature | Turkana Boy | Earlier Hominins |
|---------|-------------|------------------|
| Leg length | Long (modern) | Short |
| Arm length | Shorter (modern) | Long |
| Body shape | Tall, linear | Varied |
| Trunk | Barrel-shaped | Funnel-shaped |

### Cranial Features

| Feature | Condition |
|---------|-----------|
| Brow ridge | Heavy, projecting |
| Cranial capacity | 880 cc |
| Skull shape | Long, low |
| Face | Projecting |
| Chin | Absent |
| Forehead | Low, receding |

### Skeletal Features

| Feature | Interpretation |
|---------|----------------|
| Narrow pelvis | Efficient bipedal running |
| Long legs | Long-distance walking |
| External nose | Probable (airway projection) |
| Barrel chest | Different from apes |

## Age at Death

### Determining Age

Multiple lines of evidence:

| Method | Indication |
|--------|------------|
| Dental eruption | Modern human ~11 years |
| Long bone fusion | Modern human ~15 years |
| Dental development | Faster than modern humans |
| Combined estimate | 8-11 years (using ape rates) |

### Growth Pattern

Debate over growth rate:
- If modern human rate: ~11 years old
- If faster (ape-like) rate: ~8 years old
- Current consensus: ~8-10 years
- Was not quite fully grown

### Implications

If he died at 8-10 years:
- Already 1.6 m tall
- Would have reached ~1.85 m
- Childhood shorter than modern humans
- Brain growth pattern different

## Cause of Death

### Evidence

| Observation | Interpretation |
|-------------|----------------|
| Mandible pathology | Possible infection |
| Periosteal lesions | Disease signs |
| Vertebral abnormality | Possible scoliosis |
| No trauma | Not killed by predator |

### Leading Hypothesis

Infection from dental issues:
- Diseased lower jaw
- Possible septicemia
- Relatively quick death
- Body not scavenged (rapid burial?)

### Vertebral Issues

Some vertebrae show abnormalities:
- Possible scoliosis or kyphosis
- Congenital or developmental
- May have caused some disability

## Paleoenvironment

### Nariokotome Setting

| Feature | Evidence |
|---------|----------|
| Habitat | Near lake/river margin |
| Vegetation | Woodland |
| Climate | Warmer than today |
| Fauna | Diverse large mammals |

### Implications

Body build suggests:
- Hot, dry climate adaptation
- Long legs for ranging
- Tall, linear body for heat dissipation
- "Tropical" body form

## Significance

### Evolutionary Importance

| Revelation | Significance |
|------------|--------------|
| Modern body plan | First evidence of modern proportions |
| Tall stature | Larger than any earlier hominin |
| Long legs | Built for long-distance travel |
| Narrow hips | Efficient bipedal locomotion |

### What Turkana Boy Tells Us

1. **Size increase**: Dramatic body size evolution
2. **Proportions change**: Arms shorter, legs longer
3. **Heat adaptation**: Built for hot, open environments
4. **Locomotor efficiency**: Long-distance walking/running
5. **Life history**: Faster growth than modern humans

### Comparison with Earlier Hominins

| Feature | *A. afarensis* (Lucy) | Turkana Boy |
|---------|---------------------|-------------|
| Height | ~1.1 m | ~1.6 m (1.85 m adult) |
| Weight | ~29 kg | ~48 kg (68 kg adult) |
| Legs | Short | Long |
| Arms | Long | Shorter |
| Brain | ~400 cc | 880 cc |
| Body shape | Compact | Linear, tall |

## Taxonomic Position

### *Homo erectus* vs. *Homo ergaster*

| View | Classification |
|------|----------------|
| Lumpers | *Homo erectus* (African form) |
| Splitters | *Homo ergaster* (separate species) |
| Current trend | Often *H. erectus sensu lato* |

### Importance for Understanding *H. erectus*

- Most complete early *Homo* skeleton
- Provides body size/proportion data
- Shows sexual dimorphism when compared to others
- Baseline for understanding the species
