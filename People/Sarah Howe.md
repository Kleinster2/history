# Sarah Howe

Sarah Emily Howe was an American fraudster who operated several [[Ponzi Schemes|Ponzi schemes]] in the 1870s and 1880s—decades before [[Charles Ponzi]] gave the structure its name. Her most successful fraud, the Ladies' Deposit Company of Boston, pioneered affinity fraud by targeting unmarried women with promises of returns from a fictitious Quaker charity. At its peak, she gathered $500,000 from over 1,200 women across New England.

| Legitimacy claim | Charitable mission justified high rates |
| Reality | Classic Ponzi structure |

### Why It Worked

|--------|------|
| Gender exclusivity | Created trust, excluded skeptical men |
| Charitable framing | Made questioning seem ungrateful |
| Word of mouth | Women told friends, sisters, coworkers |
| Early payments | "Proof" the scheme worked |
| Respectability | Howe presented as dignified matron |

### Scale and Growth

| Period | Development |
|--------|-------------|
| Before April 1879 | Company opens |
| 1879-1880 | Rapid growth via word of mouth |
| Peak | 1,200+ depositors |
| Geographic reach | Boston, Buffalo, Chicago, Pittsburgh, Baltimore, Washington |
| Total deposits | ~$500,000 |

## Affinity Fraud Pioneer

### The Model

| Technique | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| Shared identity | Women helping women |
| Exclusion | No men allowed (built trust) |
| Community | Depositors recruited friends |
| Moral framing | Charity, not greed |
| Social pressure | Questioning = disloyalty |

### Why Victims Didn't Prosecute

| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Shame | Embarrassed to admit being fooled |
| Community ties | Didn't want to hurt "one of their own" |
| Complicity | Some early investors profited |
| Gender solidarity | Reluctance to punish a woman |

## Historical Significance

### Precedent for Ponzi

| Element | Later Echo |
|---------|------------|
| Structure | Identical to Ponzi's scheme |
| Scale | Large for the era |
| Press exposure | Key to collapse (as with Ponzi) |
| Targeting | Specific community (immigrants for Ponzi) |

### Regulatory Context

| Gap | Consequence |
|-----|-------------|
| No securities law | Schemes operated freely |
| State-only enforcement | Limited coordination |
| Press as regulator | Newspapers exposed fraud |
| Victim reluctance | Prosecution difficult |

## The Deeper Point

Sarah Howe's scheme demonstrates that Ponzi fraud is not a modern invention—the structure existed decades before Ponzi and exploited the same vulnerabilities: community trust, word-of-mouth validation, and the seductive power of early returns. Her innovation was affinity fraud: targeting a specific demographic (unmarried women) who shared identity and trusted each other. This made the scheme spread faster within the community and made victims reluctant to report it afterward.

The Ladies' Deposit also reveals the era's regulatory vacuum. With no SEC, no registration requirements, and limited state coordination, the *Boston Daily Advertiser* functioned as the primary fraud detector. This pattern—press investigation triggering collapse—recurred with Ponzi forty years later. The institutional response to such frauds (securities regulation, registration, enforcement agencies) came only in the 1930s, after losses had accumulated across generations.
