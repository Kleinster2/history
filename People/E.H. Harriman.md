# E.H. Harriman

Edward Henry Harriman transformed himself from a Wall Street broker into America's greatest railroad operator. Where other titans built railroads, Harriman perfected them—rebuilding the bankrupt Union Pacific into the nation's most efficient line through engineering excellence and relentless capital investment. His struggle with James J. Hill and J.P. Morgan for control of Northern Pacific triggered the Panic of 1901 and led to the Northern Securities antitrust case. At his death, Harriman controlled more railroad mileage than any individual in history, and his sons would extend the family's influence into banking and diplomacy for generations.

## Overview

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Name | Edward Henry Harriman |
| Born | February 20, 1848, Hempstead, New York |
| Died | September 9, 1909, Arden, New York |
| Industry | Railroads, finance |
| Key role | Chairman, Union Pacific Railroad |
| Peak control | 60,000+ miles of railroad |
| Legacy | Harriman family dynasty |

## Early Life

### Orlando Harriman (Father)

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Name | Rev. Orlando Harriman Jr. (1813-1881) |
| Occupation | Episcopal minister |
| Parishes | St. George's Episcopal, Hempstead, Long Island; St. John's, West Hoboken |
| Wife | Cornelia Neilson (married 1842) |
| Background | "Established social circles but constrained to middle-class existence" |
| 1850 | California gold rush attempt—went to set up church in Sacramento, failed, took 11 months to return |
| Death | April 30, 1881, Jacksonville, Florida |

### The Ministerial Origin Pattern

Both the Harriman and Bush dynasties began with Episcopal minister fathers:

| Dynasty | Minister Father | Industrial Son | Establishment Grandsons |
|---------|-----------------|----------------|-------------------------|
| Harriman | Rev. Orlando Harriman | E.H. Harriman (railroads) | Averell & Roland (Yale, S&B) |
| Bush | Rev. James Smith Bush | [[Samuel Bush]] (steel) | Prescott (Yale, S&B) |

This wasn't coincidence. Episcopal clergy occupied a specific social position:
- **Educated**: College, often seminary
- **Respectable**: Connections to established families (parishioners)
- **Not wealthy**: Clerical salaries modest
- **Social capital**: Manners, culture, networks—but no money

Minister's sons had credentials without capital. They could enter business with social advantages (how to behave, who to know) but needed to make their own fortunes. The ministry was a launching pad for ambitious sons who wanted more than modest clerical life.

### The Next Generation

| Son | Career |
|-----|--------|
| W. Averell Harriman | Yale, [[Skull and Bones]] (1913), banker, diplomat, governor; married [[Pamela Harriman]] (1971) |
| E. Roland Harriman | Yale, [[Skull and Bones]] (1917), banker |
| Harriman Brothers & Co. | Founded 1919 |
| Brown Brothers Harriman | Merged 1931 |
| See | [[Brown Brothers Harriman]], [[Skull and Bones]] |

### The Generational Pattern

| Generation | Path | Education |
|------------|------|-----------|
| E.H. Harriman | Self-made, Wall Street office boy → railroad titan | None (no Yale) |
| Averell & Roland | Inherited wealth → Yale → Skull and Bones → establishment | Yale |
| Parallel | [[Samuel Bush]] (no Yale) → [[Prescott Bush]] (Yale, S&B 1917) | Same pattern |

E.H. Harriman didn't need Yale or Skull and Bones—he controlled 60,000 miles of railroad through sheer ability. But he sent his sons to Yale to convert industrial power into establishment position. Roland Harriman and Prescott Bush were Skull and Bones classmates (both 1917), cementing the alliance that became [[Brown Brothers Harriman]]. The first generation built the fortune; the second entered the network.

## The Deeper Point

Harriman represents the Gilded Age paradox in its purest form: the same qualities that made him a monopolist made him a genuine improver. He didn't just buy railroads—he rebuilt them to standards no one else would pay for. The Union Pacific before and after Harriman were different enterprises entirely. His willingness to spend $25 million on improvements (when the entire purchase price was less) reflected a philosophy that capital investment creates value—that good railroads are more profitable than cheap ones.

Yet this operational excellence served monopolistic ends. Harriman wanted to control all western railroads precisely because competition was inefficient—duplicate lines, rate wars, boom-bust cycles. The Northern Securities holding company was his attempt to end competition permanently, with himself in charge. Roosevelt's antitrust suit didn't dispute Harriman's competence; it disputed whether one man should control transportation for half a continent.

The [[Institutions and Progress|institutional]] question Harriman poses: Is concentrated control acceptable if the controller is genuinely excellent? His railroads worked better than the fragmented alternatives. But the Sherman Act answered: no, because monopoly power persists regardless of who holds it.

Harriman's sons became diplomats and bankers rather than railroad operators—the family's power evolved from industrial control to establishment influence, the characteristic trajectory of Gilded Age dynasties. This required a deliberate transition: E.H. had no establishment credentials (no college, no social standing beyond his achievements), so he sent his sons to Yale. There they joined [[Skull and Bones]]—Averell in 1913, Roland in 1917—alongside the sons of other industrial fortunes like Prescott Bush (also 1917). The secret society was the conversion mechanism: it transformed railroad money into establishment membership.

The pattern repeated across families. E.H. Harriman and [[Samuel Bush]] were self-made men who succeeded through ability, not pedigree. Their sons—the Harriman brothers, Prescott Bush—attended Yale, joined Skull and Bones, and became partners at [[Brown Brothers Harriman]]. The bank was effectively a Bones reunion with capital. Industrial power in one generation became institutional power in the next, and the machinery that converted one to the other ran through New Haven.
