# History Vault

A history vault viewed through the lens of **economic progress**—how humanity went from subsistence to modernity.

## The Throughline

This vault explores one central question: **How did we get here?**

From hunter-gatherers to industrial civilization, from local subsistence to global markets, from muscle power to machines—this is the story of material progress. Technology, wealth, trade, institutions, innovation: all facets of one transformation.

## The Lens

Every note, whether about Cistercian monks or Chinese emperors, asks: what does this tell us about economic progress? How did people produce, trade, accumulate, innovate? What enabled growth, and what held it back?

This isn't economic history as a subdiscipline. It's history with economics as the throughline—the material story of how the world changed.
