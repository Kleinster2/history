# Oil Crisis

The oil crises of the 1970s ended the postwar boom and reshaped the global economy. When OPEC weaponized oil in 1973 and prices quadrupled again in 1979, the era of cheap energy ended. The result—stagflation—broke Keynesian economics and opened the door to a new economic order.

## Overview

### The Price Shocks

| Crisis | Date | Trigger | Price Change |
|--------|------|---------|--------------|
| First | Oct 1973 | Arab-Israeli War, embargo | $3 → $12/barrel |
| Second | 1979 | Iranian Revolution | $13 → $34/barrel |
| Combined | 1973-1980 | — | 10x increase |

### Why It Mattered

| Before 1973 | After 1979 |
|-------------|------------|
| Cheap energy assumed | Energy = strategic concern |
| Growth seemed automatic | Growth = uncertain |
| Keynesianism worked | Stagflation broke the model |
| US energy independence | Import dependence exposed |

|-------|--------------|
| Jan 1979 | $13 |

---

## Stagflation

### The Problem

| Traditional Economics | 1970s Reality |
|-----------------------|---------------|
| Inflation OR unemployment | Both simultaneously |
| Stimulus fixes recession | Stimulus worsens inflation |
| Tight money fixes inflation | Tight money worsens recession |

### The Numbers (US)

| Year | Inflation | Unemployment | GDP Growth |
|------|-----------|--------------|------------|
| 1973 | 6.2% | 4.9% | 5.6% |
| 1974 | 11.0% | 5.6% | -0.5% |
| 1975 | 9.1% | 8.5% | -0.2% |
| 1979 | 11.3% | 5.8% | 3.2% |
| 1980 | 13.5% | 7.1% | -0.3% |

### Why It Happened

| Factor | Mechanism |
|--------|-----------|
| Supply shock | Oil prices raised costs |
| Cost-push inflation | Businesses passed on costs |
| Wage-price spiral | Workers demanded raises |
| Expectations | Inflation became self-fulfilling |

---

## The Keynesian Crisis

### What Broke

| Keynesian Tool | Problem |
|----------------|---------|
| Fiscal stimulus | Worsened inflation |
| Deficit spending | Already high inflation |
| Phillips Curve | Broke down (inflation + unemployment) |
| Demand management | Supply shock, not demand problem |

### Policy Paralysis

| Action | Consequence |
|--------|-------------|
| Stimulate | More inflation |
| Contract | More unemployment |
| Do nothing | Both worsen |
| Nixon's controls | Temporary fix, worse after |

### Nixon's Wage-Price Controls (1971-1974)

| Phase | Policy |
|-------|--------|
| Phase I | 90-day freeze |
| Phase II | Guidelines, controls |
| Phase III | Voluntary |
| Phase IV | Collapse, inflation surged |

|---------|----------|
| United States | Recession, inflation |

### Developing Countries

| Effect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Oil importers | Crushing deficits |
| Debt crisis seeds | Borrowed to pay oil bills |
| Petrodollar recycling | OPEC surplus lent to LDCs |
| Winners | Oil exporters (Mexico, Nigeria, Venezuela) |

### The Petrodollar System

| Flow | Description |
|------|-------------|

## Legacy

### What the Crisis Revealed

| Revelation | Implication |
|------------|-------------|
| Energy dependence | Vulnerability |
| Keynesian limits | Supply shocks different |
| OPEC power | Cartel effectiveness |
| Inflation expectations | Self-fulfilling |

### Seeds of Neoliberalism

| Crisis Effect | Neoliberal Response |
|---------------|---------------------|
| Government failed | Less government |
| Inflation traumatic | Price stability priority |
| Unions blamed | Weaken labor |
| Regulation questioned | Deregulate |

The oil crisis didn't just raise prices—it ended an era. The confident, managed capitalism of the postwar boom gave way to something harder, more market-oriented, and more skeptical of government's ability to steer the economy.

## The Deeper Point

The oil crisis revealed that the [[Postwar Boom|postwar boom]] rested on a hidden institutional foundation: cheap, abundant energy controlled by Western companies operating under arrangements that kept producer-country governments weak. When OPEC nationalized that resource, the entire growth model—Fordist [[Mass Production|mass production]], suburban sprawl, consumer abundance—hit a wall it wasn't designed to handle. Keynesian demand management couldn't solve a supply shock; the Phillips curve broke down; stagflation was impossible under existing theory. The crisis didn't just raise prices—it exposed how much of "free market" prosperity depended on a geopolitical arrangement that kept raw materials cheap. The [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal]] turn that followed wasn't inevitable but it was logical: if the old [[Institutions and Progress|institutional]] framework couldn't handle the new reality, try a different one. The tragedy is that the baby (demand management, labor power, social insurance) went out with the bathwater (rigidity, inflation tolerance, energy complacency).
