# Australia Economic History

From convict colony to "lucky country." Australia's transformation—empty continent to wealthy nation—shows how British institutions, resource abundance, and high wages created prosperity. But it also reveals the limits of resource-dependent growth and the question of whether Australia built or merely extracted its wealth.

## The Deeper Point

Australia's economic history tests the [[Resource Curse|resource curse]] thesis in a settler colonial context. Unlike Nigeria or Venezuela, Australia developed strong institutions before resource abundance. British legal traditions, democratic governance, and high wages preceded the mining booms. This institutional foundation meant that resources supplemented rather than substituted for development.

But Horne's critique retains force. Australia remains a "quarry and a farm"—exporting rocks and crops to Asia, importing manufactures and ideas. The mining boom masked declining complexity and innovation. When commodity prices fell, the question returned: what does Australia produce besides resources?

The high-wage tradition that made Australia distinctive is under pressure. Globalization eroded protected manufacturing. Immigration increased labor supply. The arbitration system weakened. Whether Australia can maintain its living standards without the institutional arrangements that created them remains uncertain.

The "lucky country" label captures the ambiguity. Australia is lucky—good institutions, abundant resources, geographic isolation, Pacific Rim location. But luck isn't strategy, and strategy is what Australia may need as China relations deteriorate, climate change intensifies, and commodity dependence persists.
