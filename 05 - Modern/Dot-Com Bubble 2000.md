# Dot-Com Bubble 2000

The technology speculation cycle. The dot-com bubble showed how speculative manias could allocate capital to transformative infrastructure—the question is whether [[Speculative Bubbles|bubbles]] accelerate or waste innovation.

## The Build-Up (1995-1999)

### What Changed

| Development | Impact |
|-------------|--------|
| Netscape IPO (August 1995) | Opened retail investor appetite |
| World Wide Web | Commercial internet visible |
| "New Economy" narrative | Old rules don't apply |
| Low interest rates | Fed eased after 1998 crises |

### The Metrics

| Old Economy | New Economy |
|-------------|-------------|
| Earnings | "Eyeballs" (page views) |
| Revenue | Growth rate |
| Profits | Market share |
| Dividends | "Burn rate" |
| P/E ratios | "Price to dream" |

### NASDAQ Trajectory

| Date | NASDAQ Level | Commentary |
|------|--------------|------------|
| January 1995 | 750 | Pre-boom |
| January 1998 | 1,500 | Doubling |
| January 1999 | 2,200 | Acceleration |
| January 2000 | 4,000 | Euphoria |
| March 10, 2000 | 5,048 | All-time peak |

## Anatomy of the Bubble

### IPO Mania

| Feature | Example |
|---------|---------|
| First-day pops | theGlobe.com +606% |
| Lottery mentality | Allocations like winning tickets |
| Retail participation | Day traders, chat rooms |
| Underwriter incentives | Fees from volume |

### Venture Capital Flood

| Year | VC Investment |
|------|---------------|
| 1995 | $7.6 billion |
| 1998 | $21.5 billion |
| 1999 | $54.5 billion |
| 2000 | $105 billion |
| 2001 | $40.7 billion |

### Business Model Innovation (or Not)

| Model | Promise | Reality |
|-------|---------|---------|
| "Get big fast" | Network effects | Often no effects |
| "First mover advantage" | Winner take all | Fast followers won |
| "Monetize later" | Build audience first | Never monetized |
| "Land grab" | Stake claim | No profits |

## Iconic Failures

### The Poster Children

| Company | Business | Fate |
|---------|----------|------|
| Pets.com | Pet supplies online | Burned $300 million, liquidated |
| Webvan | Online grocery delivery | Burned $800 million, bankrupt |
| eToys | Online toy retail | Burned $1 billion, bankrupt |
| Kozmo.com | 1-hour delivery | Raised $280 million, closed |
| Flooz.com | Online currency | Raised $35 million, fraud |
| Boo.com | Fashion e-commerce | Burned $135 million in 18 months |

### Common Patterns

| Mistake | Example |
|---------|---------|
| Unsustainable customer acquisition | Pets.com sock puppet ads |
| Unit economics ignored | Webvan's $30 delivery cost |
| Infrastructure ahead of demand | Kozmo's warehouse network |
| Lifestyle over profit | Boo.com's lavish offices |

## The Crash (2000-2002)

### Timeline

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| March 10, 2000 | NASDAQ peaks at 5,048 |
| March-April 2000 | First decline, blamed on Y2K spending end |
| April 14, 2000 | Largest single-day point drop |
| 2000-2001 | Steady decline |
| September 11, 2001 | Market closed, further drop |
| October 9, 2002 | NASDAQ bottoms at 1,114 |

### The Destruction

| Metric | Scale |
|--------|-------|
| NASDAQ decline | -78% (peak to trough) |
| Market cap lost | $5 trillion |
| Dot-com bankruptcies | Hundreds |
| Tech job losses | 400,000+ |
| VC investment drop | -75% (2000 to 2002) |

### Who Got Hurt

| Group | Impact |
|-------|--------|
| Day traders | Wiped out |
| Tech employees | Stock options worthless, layoffs |
| Pension funds | Losses on tech holdings |
| Telecom workers | Massive layoffs |
| VCs (some) | Vintage 1999-2000 funds devastated |

## Survivors and Winners

### Who Made It

| Company | Why They Survived |
|---------|-------------------|
| Amazon | Raised capital before crash, became profitable |
| eBay | Actual marketplace, real revenue |
| Yahoo | Advertising business, though diminished |
| Priceline | Sustainable travel model |
| Google | Founded 1998, IPO 2004, actual revenue |

### What Survivors Had

| Attribute | Manifestation |
|-----------|---------------|
| Real revenue | Not "eyeballs" alone |
| Capital cushion | Cash when funding dried up |
| Path to profitability | Not "growth forever" |
| Discipline | Fired non-performers |

## Legacy Infrastructure

### What the Bubble Built

| Investment | Long-term Value |
|------------|-----------------|
| Fiber optic cable | 99% unused initially ("dark fiber") |
| Data centers | Foundation for cloud computing |
| Router/switch capacity | Network infrastructure |
| Software development | Tools, platforms, talent |
| Consumer habits | Comfort with online commerce |

### Carlota Perez Thesis

| Phase | Characteristic |
|-------|----------------|
| Installation | New technology, speculation, bubble |
| Crash | Overbuilding revealed |
| Deployment | Infrastructure used productively |
| Golden Age | Broad diffusion of benefits |

### The Infrastructure Surplus

| Dot-com Investment | Later Beneficiary |
|--------------------|-------------------|
| Fiber optic | YouTube, Netflix, streaming |
| Data centers | Amazon Web Services, cloud |
| Payment systems | E-commerce 2.0 |
| Programming talent | Web 2.0, mobile, AI |

## Fed Response and Consequences

### Greenspan's Choices

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| "Irrational exuberance" (1996) | Warned, then backed off |
| Didn't pop bubble | "Can't identify bubbles" |
| Cut rates after crash | Prevent recession |
| Kept rates low | 1% by 2003 |

### The Setup for 2008

| Policy | Consequence |
|--------|-------------|
| Low rates post-2001 | Fueled housing bubble |
| Easy money | Search for yield |
| "Greenspan put" | Moral hazard |
| Lesson | Cleaning up bubbles creates next bubble |

## Interpretations

### Was the Bubble Wasteful?

| View | Argument |
|------|----------|
| Pure waste | $5 trillion lost, bankruptcies |
| Creative destruction | Cleared unviable firms |
| Infrastructure investment | Fiber, talent, tools remained |
| Necessary speculation | How new industries get funded |

### Compared to Other Bubbles

| Bubble | Similarities | Differences |
|--------|--------------|-------------|
| Railway mania (1840s) | Infrastructure built | Real physical assets |
| South Sea (1720) | Pure speculation | No lasting infrastructure |
| Tulip (1637) | Price mania | Consumer product, not industry |
| Housing (2008) | Credit-fueled | Systemic risk |

## Lessons

### For Investors

| Lesson | Application |
|--------|-------------|
| Narratives aren't profits | "New economy" didn't suspend math |
| Cash flow matters | Eventually |
| First mover often loses | Fast followers learn cheaper |
| IPO pops → caution | Insiders selling |

### For Entrepreneurs

| Lesson | Application |
|--------|-------------|
| Burn rate discipline | Capital can disappear |
| Unit economics | Must work at scale |
| Multiple scenarios | Plan for funding drought |
| Revenue is real | Not just vanity metrics |

### For Policy

| Lesson | Application |
|--------|-------------|
| Bubbles are hard to prevent | "Irrational exuberance" didn't work |
| Cleanup creates risks | Low rates → next bubble |
| Infrastructure remains | Some waste is investment |
| Systemic risk assessment | Dot-com didn't threaten banks |

## The Deeper Point

The dot-com bubble showed how speculative manias could allocate capital to transformative infrastructure—but at enormous waste. Billions went to Pets.com and Webvan, but billions also built the fiber optic networks and data centers that later enabled Netflix, AWS, and the modern internet economy.

This raises a difficult question: are [[Speculative Bubbles|bubbles]] necessary for revolutionary technologies? The railway boom built tracks that bankrupted investors but connected economies. The dot-com boom built infrastructure that bankrupted speculators but enabled Web 2.0. Perhaps technological revolutions require irrational exuberance to attract the capital needed for speculative infrastructure investment.

The [[Institutional Economics|institutional]] question is whether better-designed systems could achieve the same infrastructure without the waste. Venture capital, stock markets, and public speculation channel capital to uncertain ventures—sometimes correctly, sometimes to sock-puppet mascots. The dot-com experience suggests that the institutions of innovation finance are inherently imprecise: they fund many failures to find few successes. The question isn't whether to eliminate this waste but whether the ratio of success to waste can be improved through better information, governance, or incentives.
