# Swedish Economic History

From peripheral iron exporter to high-tech welfare state. Sweden's transformation shows how late industrialization, labor-capital compromise, and investment in human capital can produce sustained prosperity without being first.

## Iron and Timber (1600-1870)

### Early Exports

| Period | Primary Export | Market |
|--------|---------------|--------|
| 17th century | Bar iron | Europe |
| 18th century | Iron, copper | Britain, Continent |
| 19th century | Timber, iron | Industrializing Europe |

### The Swedish Iron Industry

## The Deeper Point

Sweden's transformation from poor periphery to wealthy innovator demonstrates that [[Institutions and Progress|institutional design]] matters more than first-mover advantage. The Swedish model wasn't about redistribution—it was about creating conditions where high wages forced innovation, where universal welfare enabled risk-taking, and where labor-capital cooperation replaced destructive conflict.

The Rehn-Meidner model captured this logic: solidaristic wages squeezed out inefficient firms while active labor market policy moved workers to productive ones. The welfare state wasn't a burden on competitiveness—it was a precondition for the structural change that drove productivity growth.

When the model hit limits in the 1990s, Sweden reformed rather than abandoned its approach. The banking crisis response became a global template. Fiscal discipline restored credibility. But core institutions—universal welfare, coordinated bargaining, education investment—remained. Today's tech boom builds on this foundation: engineers from free universities, entrepreneurs backed by social safety nets, a culture of cooperation that reduces transaction costs.

Sweden proves that there's more than one path to prosperity, and that late industrializers can catch up through institutional innovation rather than imitation.
