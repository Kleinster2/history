# Development Economics

How do poor countries get rich? This question—unanswered for most of history—became urgent after decolonization created dozens of new states seeking prosperity. Development economics evolved from confident state planning (1950s) through market fundamentalism (1990s) to today's pragmatic eclecticism. Some countries (East Asia) escaped poverty spectacularly; others (much of Africa) remain trapped. The field's honest answer: we know more about what doesn't work than what does.

## Overview

### The Record

| Region | GDP/capita 1960 | GDP/capita 2023 | Success? |
|--------|-----------------|-----------------|----------|
| East Asia | $1,000 | $15,000+ | Yes |
| Latin America | $3,000 | $8,000 | Partial |
| South Asia | $600 | $2,500 | Improving |
| Sub-Saharan Africa | $1,500 | $1,800 | Mostly no |

### Evolution of Thinking

| Era | Dominant Idea |
|-----|---------------|
| 1950s-60s | Big Push, state planning |
| 1970s | Basic needs, redistribution |
| 1980s-90s | Washington Consensus, markets |
| 2000s | Institutions matter |
| 2010s+ | RCTs, pragmatic eclecticism |

## Early Development Theory (1940s-1960s)

### The Big Push

| Thinker | Idea |
|---------|------|
| Rosenstein-Rodan | Coordinated investment |
| Nurkse | Balanced growth |
| Logic | Poor countries trapped; need simultaneous investment |
| Problem | Who coordinates? How much capital? |

### Lewis Dual-Sector Model

| Sector | Character |
|--------|-----------|
| Traditional | Subsistence, surplus labor |
| Modern | Industrial, productive |
| Transfer | Move workers from traditional to modern |
| Growth | Profits reinvested |
| Limit | When surplus labor exhausted |

### Rostow's Stages

| Stage | Character |
|-------|-----------|
| Traditional society | Subsistence |
| Preconditions | Investment rises |
| Take-off | Industry grows rapidly |
| Drive to maturity | Diversification |
| Mass consumption | Developed |
| Criticism | Linear, Eurocentric |

---

## Import Substitution Industrialization (ISI)

### The Logic

| Argument | Basis |
|----------|-------|
| Prebisch-Singer thesis | Commodity terms of trade decline |
| Infant industry | New firms need protection |
| Structural disadvantage | Periphery can't compete |
| Self-reliance | Reduce dependence |

### Implementation

| Policy | Method |
|--------|--------|
| High tariffs | Protect domestic industry |
| State enterprises | Create industry directly |
| Import controls | Restrict foreign goods |
| Overvalued currency | Cheap imported inputs |

### Results

| Achievement | Failure |
|-------------|---------|
| Industry grew | Inefficient, high-cost |
| Urbanization | Rapid, unplanned |
| Some diversification | Couldn't export |
| Middle class | But rent-seeking |

### Where It Was Tried

| Region | Outcome |
|--------|---------|
| Latin America | Partial success, then crisis |
| India | "Hindu rate of growth" |
| Sub-Saharan Africa | Mostly failed |
| Turkey | Moderate success |

---

## Dependency Theory

### Core Arguments

| Thinker | Contribution |
|---------|--------------|
| Frank | "Development of underdevelopment" |
| Cardoso | Associated-dependent development |
| Wallerstein | World-systems theory |
| Amin | Unequal exchange |

### The Thesis

| Claim | Argument |
|-------|----------|
| Core exploits periphery | Structural, not accidental |
| Trade is unequal | Value flows to rich countries |
| Development impossible | Within capitalist system |
| Solution | Delinking, revolution |

### Critique

| Criticism | Evidence |
|-----------|----------|
| East Asia succeeded | Within world system |
| Trade helps growth | Export-led development works |
| Autarky failed | North Korea, Burma |
| Overly deterministic | Agency matters |

---

## Export-Oriented Industrialization

### The East Asian Model

| Element | Implementation |
|---------|----------------|
| State direction | Industrial policy, not laissez-faire |
| Education first | Human capital investment |
| Land reform | Reduced inequality |
| Export discipline | Compete globally |
| Sequenced liberalization | Open gradually |

### Why It Worked

| Factor | Mechanism |
|--------|-----------|
| Competition exposure | Exports forced efficiency |
| Learning by doing | Technology transfer |
| Scale | Global market access |
| Discipline | Bad firms fail |
| State capacity | Competent bureaucracy |

### Who Succeeded

| Country | Period |
|---------|--------|
| Japan | 1950s-1980s |
| South Korea | 1960s-1990s |
| Taiwan | 1960s-1990s |
| Singapore | 1970s-1990s |
| China | 1980s-present |
| Vietnam | 2000s-present |

## The Washington Consensus (1989)

### The Ten Commandments

| Policy | Prescription |
|--------|--------------|
| Fiscal discipline | Balance budgets |
| Public spending | Redirect to health, education |
| Tax reform | Broaden base, lower rates |
| Interest rates | Market-determined |
| Exchange rates | Competitive |
| Trade liberalization | Lower tariffs |
| FDI openness | Welcome foreign investment |
| Privatization | Sell state enterprises |
| Deregulation | Remove barriers |
| Property rights | Secure |

### Structural Adjustment

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| IMF/World Bank conditions | Reform for loans |
| Austerity | Cut spending |
| Liberalization | Open markets |
| Privatization | Sell state assets |

### Results

| Achievement | Failure |
|-------------|---------|
| Inflation reduced | Growth didn't follow |
| Markets opened | Inequality worsened |
| Some efficiency | Social costs enormous |
| Macro stability | Micro destruction |

### The Critique

| Critic | Argument |
|--------|----------|
| Stiglitz | Premature liberalization |
| Rodrik | One size doesn't fit all |
| Easterly | Aid doesn't work as planned |
| Reality | East Asia broke the rules and succeeded |

## Institutions and Development (2000s)

### "Institutions Matter"

| Thinker | Contribution |
|---------|--------------|
| North | Institutions reduce transaction costs |
| Acemoglu & Robinson | Inclusive vs. extractive institutions |
| Rodrik | Institutions = growth fundamentals |
| De Soto | Property rights for the poor |

### Inclusive vs. Extractive

| Type | Character | Examples |
|------|-----------|----------|
| Inclusive | Broad participation, property rights | South Korea, Botswana |
| Extractive | Elite capture, insecurity | Congo, Venezuela |
| Transition | Moving between | China (ambiguous) |

### Colonial Origins

| Argument | Evidence |
|----------|----------|
| Settler colonies | Got better institutions |
| Extractive colonies | Got worse institutions |
| Persistence | Institutions endure centuries |
| Implication | History constrains present |

---

## New Approaches (2010s+)

### Randomized Controlled Trials

| Innovation | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| Method | Randomized experiments on interventions |
| Pioneers | Banerjee, Duflo (Nobel 2019) |
| Focus | What works at micro level |
| Example | Deworming, microfinance, cash transfers |
| Criticism | Can't answer macro questions |

### Industrial Policy Revival

| Argument | Basis |
|----------|-------|
| East Asian success | State mattered |
| Market failures | Coordination problems |
| Green transition | Requires policy |
| New consensus | "Smart" industrial policy possible |

### The China Challenge

| Question | Issue |
|----------|-------|
| China succeeded | Without Western institutions |
| State capitalism | Works? |
| Replicable? | Probably not |
| Implication | Multiple paths exist |

---

## Persistent Puzzles

### The Middle-Income Trap

| Question | Issue |
|----------|-------|
| Many countries | Reach middle income, then stall |
| Examples | Latin America, Thailand, Malaysia |
| Why | Costs too high for cheap labor, too low-skill for innovation |
| Escaping | Requires institutional upgrade |

### Why Africa Lags

| Factor | Debate |
|--------|--------|
| Geography | Landlocked, disease, soil |
| History | Slavery, colonialism, extraction |
| Institutions | Weak, often extractive |
| Politics | Conflict, corruption |
| But | Some success (Ethiopia, Rwanda, Botswana) |

### Aid Effectiveness

| View | Argument |
|------|----------|
| Sachs | More aid needed (poverty traps) |
| Easterly | Aid mostly wasted (wrong incentives) |
| Moyo | Aid is harmful (dependency) |
| Evidence | Mixed—some programs work, system doesn't |

## What We've Learned

### Consensus Points

| Lesson | Evidence |
|--------|----------|
| Trade helps | Export-led growth works |
| Education matters | Human capital essential |
| Institutions crucial | Property rights, governance |
| No single formula | Context matters |
| State can help | If capable and accountable |

### Unresolved

| Question | Status |
|----------|--------|
| Can all countries develop? | Unknown |
| Role of democracy | Debated |
| Aid or trade? | Both, neither alone |
| Climate constraint | New challenge |
