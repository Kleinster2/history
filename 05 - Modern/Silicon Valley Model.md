# Silicon Valley Model

The institutional ecosystem that produces technology giants. Silicon Valley isn't just a place—it's a specific configuration of venture capital, university research, labor mobility, stock compensation, and cultural norms that has proven extraordinarily difficult to replicate elsewhere. Understanding why this cluster emerged in California and why imitation attempts largely fail reveals how institutional complementarities shape economic outcomes.

## The Cluster

### Geographic Concentration

| Company | Founded | Location |
|---------|---------|----------|
| Hewlett-Packard | 1939 | Palo Alto |
| Fairchild | 1957 | Mountain View |
| Intel | 1968 | Santa Clara |
| Apple | 1976 | Cupertino |
| Oracle | 1977 | Redwood City |
| Cisco | 1984 | San Jose |
| Google | 1998 | Mountain View |
| Facebook | 2004 | Menlo Park |

### What's in the Valley

| Element | Examples |
|---------|----------|
| Tech companies | 30+ Fortune 500 headquarters |
| VC firms | 40% of US venture capital |
| Universities | Stanford, Berkeley |
| Research labs | Xerox PARC, SRI, Bell Labs (nearby) |
| Law firms | Wilson Sonsini, Cooley |
| Talent pool | 400,000+ tech workers |

## Origins: The Fairchild Tree

### Shockley and the Traitorous Eight

| Event | Year | Significance |
|-------|------|--------------|
| Shockley Semiconductor | 1956 | Nobel laureate moves to Palo Alto |
| "Traitorous Eight" depart | 1957 | Found Fairchild Semiconductor |
| Fairchild innovations | 1957-68 | Integrated circuit, planar process |
| Spin-offs begin | 1961+ | Founders leave to start companies |

### The Fairchild Diaspora

| Spin-off | Year | Founders |
|----------|------|----------|
| Amelco/Teledyne | 1961 | Hoerni, Roberts |
| Signetics | 1961 | Lehman |
| Intel | 1968 | Moore, Noyce |
| AMD | 1969 | Sanders |
| National Semiconductor | 1967 | Sporck |

**The pattern**: Talented people leave successful companies to found new ones, taking knowledge, contacts, and ambition. This *wouldn't have happened* under East Coast non-compete norms.

### Why California?

| Factor | Contribution |
|--------|--------------|
| Stanford | Terman's industry partnerships |
| Military R&D | Cold War electronics contracts |
| Climate | Attracted talent |
| No non-competes | California law (Business & Professions Code 16600) |
| Distance from East | Different culture, less hierarchy |

## The Institutional Configuration

### 1. Venture Capital

| Feature | Silicon Valley Model |
|---------|---------------------|
| Structure | Limited partnerships, 10-year fund life |
| Returns | Power law (few winners pay for all) |
| Involvement | Board seats, active guidance |
| Networks | VCs share deal flow, talent, expertise |
| Risk tolerance | Expect most investments to fail |

#### VC Evolution

| Era | Character |
|-----|-----------|
| 1960s | ARD (Boston), small scale |
| 1970s | Kleiner Perkins, Sequoia founded |
| 1980s | $3-4B annual investment |
| 1990s | $100B+ (dot-com peak) |
| 2000s | $20-30B (normalized) |
| 2010s | $80-130B (new peak) |

#### Why VC Works Here

| Condition | Role |
|-----------|------|
| Deal flow | Enough startups to select from |
| Exit markets | NASDAQ, acquisitions provide liquidity |
| Talent | Experienced executives available |
| Legal infrastructure | Standard docs, known terms |
| Network density | VCs, founders, lawyers all know each other |

### 2. Stanford University

| Contribution | Mechanism |
|--------------|-----------|
| Research | Federal grants, corporate partnerships |
| Talent | PhD programs in engineering, CS |
| Entrepreneurship | Stanford Industrial Park (1951) |
| Culture | Terman encouraged commercialization |
| Spin-offs | Google, Cisco, Sun, Yahoo, HP |

#### The Terman Model

| Element | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| Industry partnerships | Companies funded research, hired graduates |
| Faculty consulting | Professors engaged with industry |
| Stanford Industrial Park | Leased land to tech companies |
| Permissive IP policy | Encouraged commercialization |

### 3. Labor Mobility

| Feature | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| No non-competes | Engineers can join competitors, start companies |
| Job-hopping norm | Average tenure 2-3 years |
| Knowledge spillovers | Ideas flow between firms |
| Network formation | Alumni networks span companies |
| Failure tolerance | Failed founders get hired, try again |

#### The California Difference

| Jurisdiction | Non-compete Enforcement |
|--------------|------------------------|
| California | Unenforceable by statute |
| Massachusetts | Enforceable (Route 128 stagnated) |
| New York | Enforceable |
| Texas | Enforceable with limits |

**The comparison**: Route 128 (Boston) had similar ingredients in 1970—MIT, defense contracts, tech companies—but enforced non-competes. By 1990, Silicon Valley had overtaken it. Saxenian's *Regional Advantage* attributes this largely to labor mobility.

### 4. Stock Compensation

| Feature | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| Stock options | Attract talent without cash |
| Upside sharing | Employees become millionaires |
| Alignment | Workers want company to succeed |
| Retention | Vesting schedules keep talent |
| Culture | Ownership mentality |

#### The Tax Advantage (Pre-2000)

| Treatment | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| Options not expensed | Didn't reduce earnings |
| Capital gains on exercise | Lower tax rate |
| AMT complications | But still advantageous |
| Incentive stock options | Additional benefits |

### 5. Risk Tolerance Culture

| Norm | Manifestation |
|------|---------------|
| Failure acceptable | Failed founders get funded again |
| "Fail fast" | Pivot or shut down quickly |
| Optimism bias | Believe in unlikely success |
| Status from startups | Founding > joining big company |
| Network support | Founders help each other |

## Why Imitation Fails

### Failed Clusters

| Attempt | Problem |
|---------|---------|
| Route 128 (Boston) | Non-competes blocked knowledge flow |
| Sophia Antipolis (France) | Government-planned, no organic growth |
| Tsukuba (Japan) | Research without commercialization culture |
| Bangalore | Outsourcing, not frontier innovation |
| Many others | Missing complementary institutions |

### The Missing Pieces

| Element Often Missing | Why It Matters |
|----------------------|----------------|
| VC ecosystem | Need experienced VCs, not just money |
| Legal infrastructure | Standard docs, known norms |
| Failure tolerance | Cultural, not policy |
| Labor mobility | Requires legal change + cultural acceptance |
| Exit markets | Need liquid public markets or acquirers |
| Research universities | Decades to build |

### Partial Successes

| Cluster | What Works |
|---------|------------|
| Israel | VC, military R&D, talent; but small exits |
| China (Shenzhen/Beijing) | Scale, capital, talent; but different model |
| Seattle | Microsoft/Amazon anchors; less VC-centric |
| Austin | Cost advantage, talent inflow; emerging |

---

## The Network Effects

### Knowledge Spillovers

| Mechanism | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| Job mobility | Engineers carry knowledge between firms |
| Informal networks | Hobbyist clubs (Homebrew Computer Club) |
| Conferences | Industry gatherings share information |
| VC networks | Portfolio company knowledge shared |

### Thick Labor Markets

| Benefit | Mechanism |
|---------|-----------|
| Specialization | Enough demand for niche skills |
| Matching | Find right person for specific role |
| Risk reduction | If startup fails, other jobs available |
| Salary discovery | Market rates well-known |

### Service Provider Ecosystem

| Service | Specialized Providers |
|---------|----------------------|
| Legal | Wilson Sonsini, Cooley, Fenwick |
| Accounting | Big Four startup practices |
| Recruiting | Specialized tech recruiters |
| PR | Tech-focused agencies |
| Banking | Silicon Valley Bank (until 2023) |

---

## Critiques and Challenges

### The Dark Side

| Problem | Manifestation |
|---------|---------------|
| Housing costs | Median home $1.5M+ |
| Inequality | Tech wealth vs. service workers |
| Homogeneity | Underrepresentation of women, minorities |
| Short-termism | Growth over sustainability |
| Disruption ideology | "Move fast and break things" |

### Recent Challenges

| Challenge | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| Remote work | Geographic dispersion (COVID) |
| Regulation | Antitrust scrutiny, content moderation |
| Competition | China tech, other clusters |
| Housing crisis | Talent leaving for Austin, Miami |
| SVB collapse (2023) | Exposed financial fragility |

### Is the Model Replicable Now?

| Argument | Position |
|----------|----------|
| Yes | Remote work, capital mobility, global talent |
| No | Network effects compound, incumbents dominate |
| Partially | Specific niches can emerge elsewhere |

## The Deeper Point

Silicon Valley is an institutional configuration, not a collection of smart people or available capital. The specific combination—venture capital structured as limited partnerships with power-law return expectations, California's ban on non-compete agreements, Stanford's commercialization-friendly culture, stock options as compensation, and failure-tolerant social norms—produces outcomes impossible to achieve by importing individual elements.

The [[Varieties of Capitalism]] framework explains why: institutions are *complementary*. VC works because labor mobility exists; labor mobility is valuable because VC provides capital for new ventures; stock options attract talent because exit markets provide liquidity; exit markets are liquid because there's deal flow. Remove one element and the system degrades. This is why government-planned tech parks consistently fail: they can provide buildings and tax breaks but cannot legislate the social norms, legal frameworks, and network density that make the Valley work.

The model also reveals the tradeoffs in [[American Business Strategy]]. The same labor flexibility that enables knowledge spillovers creates job insecurity. The same risk tolerance that funds moonshots wastes capital on failures. The same growth focus that produces giants produces monopolies. The same disruption ideology that enables innovation destroys incumbents and communities. Silicon Valley is the purest expression of [[Creative Destruction]] as economic system—enormously productive, deeply destabilizing, and institutionally specific to America.
