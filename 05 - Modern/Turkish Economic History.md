# Turkish Economic History

From Ottoman remnant to emerging market. Turkey's transformation from multi-ethnic empire to nation-state, from agricultural backwater to industrial economy, shows the possibilities and pitfalls of state-led development. Recurring crises reveal how institutional inconsistency—market reforms without rule of law—produces volatility.

## The Republic's Inheritance

## The Deeper Point

Turkish economic history demonstrates how [[Institutions and Progress|institutional inconsistency]] produces volatile outcomes. Turkey has had periods of impressive growth—the 1960s, the 2000s—but also repeated crises that destroyed gains. The pattern suggests structural problems beyond bad luck.

The fundamental issue is incomplete institutional reform. Markets were liberalized, but rule of law didn't keep pace. Property rights remain insecure when political winds shift. The judiciary lacks independence. Central bank autonomy was granted, then revoked. Each crisis forces reforms; each recovery sees backsliding.

The EU accession process illustrated the value of external anchors. When EU membership seemed possible, Turkey had incentive for institutional reform. When the process stalled, the anchor was lost. Domestic political logic—centralization, patronage—reasserted itself.

The recurring inflation problem reveals the political economy of macroeconomic policy. Governments gain from inflation in the short run (reduced real debt, construction booms), while costs fall on savers and workers. Without institutional constraints—independent central bank, fiscal rules—the temptation proves irresistible.

The contrast with other emerging markets is instructive. Korea and Taiwan graduated to high-income status with sustained institutional development. Turkey's per-capita income has oscillated for decades, never achieving sustained convergence. The difference isn't geography or culture but institutional quality—and institutional quality requires political commitment that has repeatedly been lacking.
