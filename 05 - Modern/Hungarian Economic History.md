## The Deeper Point

Hungary's trajectory reveals how [[Institutions and Progress|institutional weakness]] can persist across regime changes. The pattern of extraction by narrow elites—Habsburg magnates, communist party, Orbán's circle—shows continuity beneath surface transformations. "Goulash communism" looked like reform but maintained party control. Post-transition FDI looked like integration but left domestic institutions weak. Orbán's "national capitalism" looks like sovereignty but redistributes to cronies.

The contrast with Poland is instructive. Both had similar starting points and transition strategies. But Poland built stronger institutions through shock therapy's pain, while Hungary's gradualism preserved more elite continuity. When EU conditionality weakened after accession, Hungary's weaker institutions couldn't resist capture.

The EU-Hungary conflict over rule of law is fundamentally about institutions. EU integration was supposed to lock in institutional quality. Instead, Hungary shows that formal membership isn't enough—domestic political economy can hollow out institutions from within while maintaining formal compliance.

Hungary's economic growth under Orbán, powered by EU funds and German supply chains, doesn't refute this analysis. Extractive institutions can deliver growth when external resources flow in. The question is what happens when conditions change—and whether the institutional erosion creates long-term vulnerability that current prosperity masks.
