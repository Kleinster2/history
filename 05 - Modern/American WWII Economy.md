# American WWII Economy

World War II transformed the United States from a Depression-wracked economy into the world's industrial superpower. In six years, American output nearly doubled, unemployment vanished, and the federal government demonstrated it could mobilize the entire economy for a single purpose. The war ended the Great Depression, created the military-industrial complex, and established the economic foundations for postwar American dominance.
