# European Economic Miracle

After 1945, Western Europe rebuilt from rubble into the world's largest integrated market. Growth averaged 5-6% annually for a generation—faster than ever before or since. The German Wirtschaftswunder, French Trente Glorieuses, and Italian Miracolo Economico created prosperous societies that combined market economies with strong welfare states. European integration turned former enemies into trading partners, proving that managed capitalism could deliver both growth and equity.

## Overview

## The Deeper Point

The European miracle's deepest lesson is that there is no single institutional formula for growth. Germany's codetermination and social market economy, France's indicative planning, Italy's family-firm industrial districts—all achieved rapid convergence through radically different mechanisms. The common thread wasn't a specific policy but an institutional orientation: channeling Marshall Plan capital and Cold War urgency into productive investment rather than rent-seeking. Hall and Soskice's "varieties of capitalism" framework captures this: liberal market economies (Anglo-Saxon) and coordinated market economies (Continental) are equally capable of growth, but through different institutional complementarities. The European integration project then added a meta-institutional layer—creating competition between national systems while providing a common market that rewarded [[Innovation Economics|innovation]] over protection. The result proved that [[Institutions and Progress|institutional diversity]], not convergence on a single model, is the engine of progress.
