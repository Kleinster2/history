# Precision Manufacturing

Precision is cumulative: each generation of tools enables the next. Medieval clocks required precision gears; precision gears enabled scientific instruments; scientific instruments enabled machine tools; machine tools enabled interchangeable parts; interchangeable parts enabled mass production. The "machine tool industry"—making machines that make machines—was the core of industrial capability. Countries that built precision manufacturing capacity industrialized; those that couldn't remained dependent.

## The Deeper Point

Precision is the foundation of modern manufacturing—and it's cumulative. Each generation's tools enable the next's. Medieval clockmakers developed skills that passed to instrument makers who passed them to machine tool builders. Maudslay's precision lathe could cut screws accurate enough to make better lathes. Whitworth's measurement standards enabled parts to fit regardless of which machine made them. This cumulative character means that precision is an [[Institutions and Progress|institutional]] capability: countries that built machine tool industries could make anything requiring precision; those that didn't remained dependent. Germany and Switzerland built precision cultures over centuries; Japan built one deliberately after Meiji. The [[Industrial Revolution]] required not just new machines but the ability to make machines precisely—and that ability was concentrated in countries with the institutional infrastructure (training, standards, accumulated skills) to develop it. Today semiconductor manufacturing requires positioning accurate to nanometers—possible only because centuries of cumulative precision-building created the tools that make those tools. Precision manufacturing is the meta-technology that enables all other technologies.
