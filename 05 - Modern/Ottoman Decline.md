# Ottoman Decline

How the empire fell behind. From the 17th century onward, the Ottoman Empire—once Europe's greatest power—experienced relative decline against rising Western states. Military defeats, institutional rigidity, and unequal trade arrangements combined to transform a great power into the "Sick Man of Europe."

## The Decline Question

### What Declined?

| Dimension | Pattern |
|-----------|---------|
| Military | Lost wars from late 17th c. |
| Economic | Relative, not absolute |
| Institutional | Rigidity vs. European dynamism |
| Territorial | Shrinkage accelerated |

### Timing Debate

| View | Argument |
|------|----------|
| Traditional | Decline from 1600 |
| Revisionist | Transformation, not decline |
| Relative | Fell behind more than failed |

## Military Decline

### The Turning Point

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| 1683 | Siege of Vienna fails |
| 1699 | Treaty of Karlowitz—first major losses |
| 18th c. | Defeats by Russia, Austria |
| 19th c. | "Eastern Question" |

### Why Military Decline?

| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Janissary degradation | Elite force became obstacle |
| Technology gap | European military revolution |
| Fiscal constraints | Couldn't finance modern armies |
| Institutional rigidity | Slow adaptation |

## Economic Dimensions

### Trade Position

| Period | Character |
|--------|-----------|
| 16th c. | Ottoman-controlled routes valuable |
| 17th c.+ | Atlantic shift |
| Trade routes | Bypassed by sea |
| Terms | Increasingly unfavorable |

### The Capitulations

| Feature | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| Trade privileges | Europeans exempt from Ottoman law |
| Origin | 16th c. grants to allies |
| Evolution | Became instruments of penetration |
| Tariffs | Ottomans couldn't protect industry |

### Capitulations Detailed

| Privilege | Consequence |
|-----------|-------------|
| Low tariffs (3-5%) | Can't protect manufacturing |
| Legal extraterritoriality | Europeans under own law |
| Residence rights | Merchant colonies |
| Effect | Unequal economic relationship |

## Institutional Explanations

### What Stopped Working

| Institution | Problem |
|-------------|---------|
| Timar system | Devolved, corrupt |
| Janissaries | Became hereditary, rebellious |
| Guilds | Blocked innovation |
| Ulema | Resisted change |

### The Reform Paradox

| Problem | Difficulty |
|---------|------------|
| Needed reform | To compete |
| Reformers blocked | By beneficiaries of status quo |
| External pressure | From capitulations |
| Internal resistance | From vested interests |

### Comparison with West

| Ottoman | Western States |
|---------|----------------|
| No printing until 1729 | Gutenberg 1450 |
| Guild controls | Breaking down |
| Land tenure rigid | Enclosure, consolidation |
| State revenue stagnant | Growing fiscal capacity |

## Reform Attempts

### Selim III (1789-1807)

| Reform | Fate |
|--------|------|
| New army (Nizam-i Cedid) | Janissaries rebelled |
| Administrative reform | Incomplete |
| Outcome | Deposed, killed |

### Mahmud II (1808-1839)

| Achievement | Method |
|-------------|--------|
| Destroyed Janissaries (1826) | "Auspicious Incident" |
| Centralization | Provincial reform |
| Military modernization | Began |
| Cost | Fiscal strain |

### Tanzimat (1839-1876)

| Reform | Goal |
|--------|------|
| Gülhane Decree | Equal rights regardless of religion |
| Legal reform | Western-style codes |
| Education | Modern schools |
| Administration | Bureaucratic state |

### Tanzimat Limits

| Achievement | Limitation |
|-------------|------------|
| Legal modernization | Capitulations remained |
| Administrative reform | Debt grew |
| Education | Slow diffusion |
| Economy | Industrial gap widened |

## The Debt Trap

### Ottoman Borrowing

| Period | Development |
|--------|-------------|
| 1854 | First foreign loan (Crimean War) |
| 1860s-70s | Debt accumulated |
| 1875 | Default |
| 1881 | Ottoman Public Debt Administration |

### Debt Administration

| Feature | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| Foreign control | Revenue streams assigned |
| Sovereignty | Compromised |
| Investment | Directed by creditors |
| Legacy | Resentment, nationalism |

## Economic Structure in Late Period

### Manufacturing

| Status | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| Traditional crafts | Survived |
| Modern industry | Limited |
| Competition | European imports |
| Protection | Impossible (capitulations) |

### Agriculture

| Feature | Character |
|---------|-----------|
| Export crops | Increased |
| Cotton | For European mills |
| Infrastructure | Railways built (foreign) |
| Peasantry | Condition varied |

### Regional Variation

| Region | Development |
|--------|-------------|
| Balkans | Lost (independence) |
| Anatolia | Core, modest development |
| Arab lands | Varied by area |
| Egypt | Autonomous, developing |

## The End

### Young Turks (1908)

| Goal | Achievement |
|------|-------------|
| Constitution | Restored |
| Modernization | Accelerated |
| Nationalism | Turkish identity |
| Wars | Balkan, then World War |

### World War I

| Event | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| Joined Central Powers | 1914 |
| Military defeat | Multiple fronts |
| Arab Revolt | Lost Arab lands |
| Armistice | 1918, occupation |
| Successor | Turkish Republic (1923) |

## The Deeper Point

Ottoman decline shows how [[Institutions and Progress|institutional rigidity]] can transform strength into weakness. The institutions that had made the empire strong—the timar system, the Janissaries, the guild structure, the ulema—became obstacles when conditions changed. Vested interests blocked reform; reformers who pushed too hard were overthrown.

The capitulations reveal how institutional disadvantages compound. What began as diplomatic concessions became instruments of economic penetration. Unable to raise tariffs, the Ottomans couldn't protect nascent industries. Foreign goods flooded markets; local producers couldn't compete. The legal framework that had once demonstrated Ottoman confidence became a cage.

The reform attempts illustrate the difficulty of institutional change. Each reform effort faced resistance from those who benefited from the status quo. Selim III was killed for his efforts; Mahmud II succeeded only by massacring the Janissaries. The Tanzimat achieved much but couldn't overcome the structural constraints of capitulations and debt.

The debt trap showed how fiscal weakness creates political vulnerability. Borrowing to finance reforms and wars led to default; default led to foreign administration of revenues; foreign administration compromised sovereignty. The empire's fate was increasingly decided in London and Paris.

The comparison with [[Islamic World Technological Stagnation]] is instructive. The Ottoman case wasn't unique Muslim decline but a specific pattern: institutions that worked in one era becoming obstacles in another. The question isn't why Islam declined but why specific Ottoman institutions couldn't adapt as European institutions did.
