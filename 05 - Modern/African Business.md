# African Business

African business operates between two worlds: a vast informal sector employing most workers outside any formal structure, and an emerging class of indigenous conglomerates finally displacing colonial-era foreign dominance. From Nigeria's Dangote to Kenya's M-Pesa to South Africa's diversified corporates, African business is evolving rapidly—but within institutional constraints inherited from colonialism and shaped by weak [[State Capacity|state capacity]]. The continent's 1.4 billion people and fastest-growing populations make it the last great frontier for business development.

## The Deeper Point

African business demonstrates what happens when [[Institutions and Progress|institutional]] constraints inherited from colonialism meet indigenous [[Entrepreneurship|entrepreneurial]] ambition. Colonial powers built [[State Capacity|state capacity]] for extraction—ports connected to mines, not to each other—while deliberately excluding Africans from formal business. Independence brought indigenization policies that transferred ownership but not capability, and structural adjustment that liberalized markets before institutions could support them. The result: a vast informal sector where most African business actually happens, operating outside formal institutions because formal institutions are costly, unreachable, or unreliable. The emerging indigenous conglomerates—Dangote, MTN, Equity Bank—succeed by building institutional capacity internally (reliable power, training, logistics) that the state fails to provide externally. M-Pesa's success illustrates institutional leapfrogging: in the absence of bank infrastructure, mobile money created financial inclusion from scratch. The [[Varieties of Capitalism]] framework barely applies—African economies are not coordinated or liberal market economies but *weak-institution economies* where business must substitute for missing state functions. The Chinese presence is double-edged: investment in infrastructure that states couldn't afford, but also competition that crowds out indigenous manufacturing. The deeper pattern: Africa's business future depends on whether states can build the [[State Capacity|capacity]] to enforce [[Property Rights|property rights]], provide infrastructure, and create the institutional environment where formal business can outcompete informality. Without that, even successful entrepreneurs remain islands of capability in a sea of institutional weakness.
