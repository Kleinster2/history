# Corporate Evolution

The corporation is the dominant institution of modern capitalism. From the managerial revolution of the 1920s through conglomerate empires, multinational expansion, shareholder capitalism, and today's platform giants, corporate forms evolved to coordinate ever-larger economic activity. How firms are owned, governed, and organized shapes who benefits from economic progress—shareholders, workers, managers, or society.

| 1980-2000 | Shareholder-focused | Maximize stock price |
