# Why Africa Lagged

Sub-Saharan Africa is the region where the development promise has been most disappointed. At independence (1960s), many African countries had income levels comparable to East Asia. Sixty years later, East Asia is industrialized and wealthy; much of Africa remains poor. The explanations—geography, culture, colonialism, governance, resources—have been debated endlessly. The institutional view synthesizes them: Africa's poverty reflects institutions designed for extraction at every layer (pre-colonial, colonial, post-colonial), combined with weak [[State Capacity|state capacity]] to reform them. But the story isn't uniform: Botswana, Rwanda, Mauritius, and recent risers show that African development is possible.

## Overview

### The Numbers

| Measure | Sub-Saharan Africa | East Asia |
|---------|-------------------|-----------|
| GDP per capita (1960) | ~$1,500 | ~$1,000 |
| GDP per capita (2023) | ~$1,800 | ~$15,000 |
| Growth (1960-2000) | Near zero | ~5% annual |
| Growth (2000-2023) | ~2-3% | ~4-5% |
| Poverty rate | ~35% | ~3% |

### The Puzzle

| Question | Dimension |
|----------|-----------|
| Why no industrialization? | Remained primary exporters |
| Why weak states? | Can't deliver services, enforce rules |
| Why conflict? | Civil wars, coups, instability |
| Why now improving? | 2000s growth, some success stories |

## Pre-Colonial Factors

### Geography Arguments

| Factor | Proposed Effect |
|--------|-----------------|
| Tropics | Disease burden, agricultural challenges |
| Landlocked | 15 countries without coast |
| Fragmented terrain | Hard to build states |
| Tsetse fly | Blocked animal husbandry |

### Pre-Colonial Institutions

| Pattern | Character |
|---------|-----------|
| Stateless societies | Acephalous, no central authority |
| Trading states | Ghana, Mali, Songhai (West Africa) |
| Great Zimbabwe | Southern African trade |
| Diversity | Enormous variation across continent |

### The Slave Trade Effect (Nunn)

| Finding | Mechanism |
|---------|-----------|
| Slave exports correlate with poverty today | Long-run effect |
| Violence, distrust | Raiding destroyed social capital |
| Institutional damage | States weakened or predatory |
| Ethnic fragmentation | Divide-and-capture strategies |
| Population loss | Demographic disaster |

---

## The Colonial Impact

### Colonial Extraction Systems

| Pattern | Where | Character |
|---------|-------|-----------|
| Settler colonialism | South Africa, Zimbabwe, Kenya | Land expropriation |
| Concession companies | Congo, French Africa | Private extraction |
| Indirect rule | Nigeria, Ghana | Chiefs as intermediaries |
| Forced labor | French, Belgian, Portuguese | Coerced cultivation |

### What Colonialism Left

| Legacy | Consequence |
|--------|-------------|
| Artificial borders | Ethnic fragmentation, conflict |
| Thin administration | No state capacity tradition |
| Export orientation | Ports and rails to coast, not internal |
| Education for few | Thin elite, mass illiteracy |
| Extraction institutions | Designed to take, not build |

### The Reversal of Fortune Pattern

| Pre-colonial | Colonial | Post-colonial |
|--------------|----------|---------------|
| Decentralized societies | Easier to conquer | Weaker states today |
| Trading states | Turned to extraction | Lost development momentum |
| Population density | Attracted extraction | Institutional damage |

## Post-Independence Failures

### The Initial Choices

| Strategy | Countries | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| African socialism | Tanzania, Ghana, Guinea | Stagnation |
| State-led ISI | Kenya, Nigeria | Partial industrialization |
| One-party states | Most | Authoritarianism without development |
| Continued extraction | Congo (Mobutu) | Kleptocracy |

### Why Strategies Failed

| Factor | Problem |
|--------|---------|
| State capacity | Too weak to implement plans |
| Elite capture | Independence for few, not many |
| Cold War | Superpowers backed dictators |
| Commodity dependence | Price volatility |
| Debt | 1980s crisis devastated |

### The Lost Decades (1980s-1990s)

| Crisis | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Debt crisis | Structural adjustment imposed |
| Commodity crash | Export revenues collapsed |
| AIDS epidemic | Demographic, economic disaster |
| Civil wars | 20+ conflicts |
| State collapse | Somalia, Liberia, DRC |

## Competing Explanations

### Geography Thesis (Sachs)

| Argument | Counter |
|----------|---------|
| Tropics are harder | Singapore, Malaysia are tropical |
| Disease burden | Endogenous to institutions |
| Landlocked | Switzerland, Austria are landlocked |
| Conclusion | Geography matters, but isn't determinative |

### Institutions Thesis (AJR)

| Argument | Evidence |
|----------|----------|
| Extractive colonial institutions | Persist after independence |
| Weak states | Can't enforce property rights |
| Elite capture | Independence didn't change incentives |
| See | [[Reversal of Fortune]] |

### Ethnic Fractionalization

| Argument | Counter |
|----------|---------|
| Ethnic diversity → conflict | Tanzania has diversity, peace |
| Patronage politics | Ethnic voting patterns |
| Colonial manipulation | Europeans created divisions |
| Can be overcome | With right institutions |

### Resource Curse

| Argument | Evidence |
|----------|----------|
| Oil/minerals → poor governance | Nigeria, Angola, Congo |
| Mechanism | Rent capture, Dutch disease |
| Exceptions | Botswana, Norway |
| See | [[Resource Curse]] |

### External Factors

| Factor | Mechanism |
|--------|-----------|
| Terms of trade | Commodity prices |
| Debt | Structural adjustment |
| Aid | Dependency, bypassing state |
| Trade barriers | Rich country protectionism |
| Cold War | Backed dictators for alignment |

## The Deeper Point

Africa's development challenge is [[Institutions and Progress|institutional]] at every layer. Pre-colonial institutions were disrupted (slave trade) or co-opted (indirect rule). Colonial institutions were designed for extraction, not African development—thin administration, education for few, infrastructure pointing to ports. Post-colonial institutions often continued extraction through new elites, with state weakness making reform impossible even where leaders wanted it. The [[Reversal of Fortune]] thesis applies doubly: Africa was relatively less developed pre-colonially (which attracted extraction) and inherited weaker institutions at independence. But the story isn't hopeless: Botswana shows that good institutions can emerge; Rwanda shows that reconstruction is possible; Ethiopia and others show that industrial policy can work. The [[Resource Curse]] isn't destiny—it's a specific institutional failure that can be avoided. The difference between Nigeria (cursed) and Botswana (blessed) isn't diamonds vs. oil—it's whether [[State Capacity|state capacity]] existed to manage windfalls productively. [[Development Economics]] has learned humility from Africa: no formula works everywhere, and the institutional prerequisites for growth can't be imported or imposed. They must be built—and the building is hard when the starting point is extraction designed at every level to prevent accumulation by Africans. The path forward requires simultaneous work on governance, infrastructure, human capital, and economic structure—and patience with the pace of change.
