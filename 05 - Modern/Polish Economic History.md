# Polish Economic History

From Europe's largest medieval kingdom to partitioned non-existence to communist satellite to EU success story. Poland's trajectory shows how extractive institutions (the [[Second Serfdom]], partition, communism) can persist across political regimes—and how shock therapy combined with EU integration can break the cycle.

## The Long Decline (1500-1795)

### Poland-Lithuania at Its Peak

| Period | Character |
|--------|-----------|

## The Deeper Point

Poland's economic history is a story of [[Institutions and Progress|institutional]] extraction and its eventual escape. The [[Second Serfdom]] bound Polish peasants to landlords while Western peasants gained freedom. The noble republic's weak state capacity enabled partitioning powers to erase Poland from the map. Communist central planning replaced one form of extraction with another.

What changed? The shock therapy of 1990 was painful, but it broke the continuity of extractive institutions that had persisted through noble dominance, partition, and communism. Crucially, EU accession locked in institutional reforms—competition policy, rule of law, property rights—that previous regimes had lacked.

The Polish success shows that the [[Post-Communist Transition|transition]] from communism wasn't just about getting prices right. It required institutional transformation: secure property rights, independent courts, functioning banks, EU standards. Countries that achieved this transformation (Poland, Czech Republic, Baltics) converged toward Western Europe. Those that didn't (Russia, Ukraine, Belarus) stagnated or regressed.

Poland's recent political tensions around judicial independence are concerning precisely because they threaten the institutional foundations that enabled growth. The question is whether Polish institutions are robust enough to survive political stress—or whether the old pattern of institutional weakness will reassert itself.
