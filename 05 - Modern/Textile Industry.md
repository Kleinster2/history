# Textile Industry

Textiles were the first industry—the proving ground for every institutional and technological innovation of industrial capitalism. The spinning jenny and power loom launched the [[Industrial Revolution]]; Lancashire's mills were the first factories; textile wages were the first labor movement's cause. And textiles remained the gateway industry as industrialization spread: Britain to New England, New England to the American South, the South to Japan, Japan to Korea, Korea to China, China to Bangladesh. Every country that industrialized did so through textiles first. The industry's global march shows how comparative advantage shifts when labor costs rise—and how [[Creative Destruction|creative destruction]] works across borders.

## Overview

## The Deeper Point

Textiles demonstrate the geographical shifting of industrial [[Creative Destruction|creative destruction]] across countries. The industry moved from Britain to New England to the American South to Japan to the Tigers to China to Bangladesh not because technology changed but because comparative advantage shifted: as wages rose in each location, production moved to lower-wage alternatives, while the departing countries moved "up" to higher-value industries. This is Baumol applied geographically: [[Entrepreneurship|entrepreneurial]] ambition in high-wage countries finds textiles unprofitable and moves to other sectors; ambitious entrepreneurs in low-wage countries find textiles the gateway to industrialization. The [[Varieties of Capitalism|institutional]] lesson is that textiles require minimal infrastructure—ports, cheap labor, basic machines—which is why they're the first industry everywhere. The pattern suggests textiles are a temporary phase: countries that stay in textiles don't develop; countries that use textiles as a stepping stone do. Bangladesh's challenge is whether it can follow Korea's path (textiles → electronics → high-value) or remain stuck in low-margin garments. The [[Global Supply Chains|global supply chain]] model—brands in rich countries, production in poor ones—creates wealth but also vulnerability: Rana Plaza showed what happens when brands outsource production but not responsibility. The fast fashion model takes creative destruction to its environmental limit: constant new styles, instant obsolescence, mountains of waste. Whether sustainability concerns will slow the textile machine remains the industry's open question.
