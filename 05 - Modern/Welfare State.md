# Welfare State

The welfare state—government provision of social insurance, health care, education, and income support—emerged in the late 19th century and expanded dramatically after World War II. Different models developed (Scandinavian, Continental, Anglo-American), but all represent state intervention to provide economic security. The welfare state transformed the relationship between states, markets, and citizens.
