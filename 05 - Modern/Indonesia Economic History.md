# Indonesia Economic History

Indonesia is Southeast Asia's giant: 275 million people across 17,000 islands, the world's largest Muslim-majority country, and an economy that has grown from post-colonial poverty to middle-income status. From Dutch exploitation to Sukarno's nationalism to Suharto's development authoritarianism to the 1997 Asian crisis to post-crisis democracy, Indonesia's trajectory illustrates how natural resources, political stability, and global conditions interact to shape development.

## The Deeper Point

Indonesia's development illustrates both the possibilities and limits of resource-rich, archipelagic development. The New Order achieved genuine poverty reduction and stability—but through authoritarianism and crony capitalism that left the system fragile. The 1997 crisis exposed how quickly apparent success can unravel when [[Institutions and Progress\|institutions]] are weak. Post-crisis democracy has proven more resilient than skeptics expected, with peaceful transfers of power and maintained growth. But Indonesia faces the [[Economic Convergence\|middle-income trap]]: it has exhausted the easy gains from resource extraction and labor-intensive manufacturing without building the [[Human Capital]] and innovation capacity for the next stage. The nickel strategy—banning raw ore exports to force downstream processing—represents an attempt to use resource leverage for industrial policy, a gamble that [[Development Economics\|development economists]] watch closely. Indonesia's size and complexity mean its success or failure matters for hundreds of millions of people, and offers lessons for other resource-rich developing countries.
