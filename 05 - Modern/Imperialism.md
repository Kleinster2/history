# Imperialism

The New Imperialism (roughly 1870-1914) saw European powers, the United States, and Japan aggressively expand their control over Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. Unlike earlier colonialism, this wave featured direct territorial control, the "Scramble for Africa," and ideological justifications rooted in nationalism, racism, and social Darwinism. Economic motives included raw materials, markets, and investment opportunities.
