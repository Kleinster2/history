## Diversification Challenge

### Economic Structure

## The Deeper Point

Botswana proves the [[Resource Curse|resource curse]] isn't inevitable—the question is what [[Institutions and Progress|institutional choices]] made the difference. At independence in 1966, Botswana was among the world's poorest countries. Diamonds were discovered a year later. The classic resource curse story would predict conflict, corruption, and stagnation. Instead, Botswana became Africa's development success story.

What made the difference?

- **Pre-existing institutions**: The Tswana had consultative governance traditions (kgotla) and property rights in cattle. These weren't destroyed by colonialism's benign neglect.
- **Leadership**: Seretse Khama and his cabinet were educated, honest, and long-term oriented. They made choices—save before spending, invest in public goods, maintain bureaucratic quality—that compounded over decades.
- **Credible commitment**: Both Botswana and De Beers honored long-term agreements. This enabled investment and fair revenue sharing.
- **Delayed gratification**: Unlike [[Nigeria Economic History|Nigeria]], Botswana didn't spend immediately. It built reserves, then infrastructure, then services.

But Botswana also shows limits: diamonds employed few, Dutch disease discouraged diversification, and inequality remained high. The success was in *managing* resource wealth, not in building a diversified economy. As diamonds deplete, Botswana faces the challenge of sustaining development beyond the resource that funded it.

The comparison with Nigeria is stark: similar resources, opposite outcomes. The difference is institutional—and institutions are built through historical processes that aren't easily replicated. Botswana's lesson is hopeful (the curse can be escaped) and sobering (the conditions for escape are demanding).
