# American Civil War

The American Civil War was the bloodiest conflict in US history and a decisive economic event. It pitted an industrializing North against an agricultural South whose wealth was concentrated in enslaved people. The war destroyed the slave economy, demonstrated the power of industrial mobilization, and set the stage for America's rise as the world's largest economy.

## Overview

### Two Economies

| Factor | North | South |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Population | 22 million | 9 million (incl. 3.5M enslaved) |
| Manufacturing output | 90% of US total | 10% |
| Railroad mileage | 22,000 miles | 9,000 miles |
| Bank deposits | $207 million | $47 million |
| Economic model | Industrial, diversified | Agricultural, export-dependent |

### The Stakes

| For South | For North |
|-----------|-----------|
| ~$3 billion in slave "property" | Free labor ideology |
| Cotton export economy | Unified national market |
| Political power via 3/5 clause | Tariff and banking policy |

---

## Economic Causes

### Sectional Tensions

| Issue | Northern Position | Southern Position |
|-------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Tariffs | Protective (help industry) | Low (free trade for cotton) |
| Western lands | Free soil, homesteads | Slave expansion |
| Banking | National bank, sound money | State banks, easy credit |
| Internal improvements | Federal support | States' rights |

### The Slavery Question

| Dimension | Reality |
|-----------|---------|
| Profitability | Slavery highly profitable through 1860 |
| Expansion | South needed new slave states for political balance |
| Capital | Enslaved people = largest capital stock in South |
| Threat perception | Republicans seen as existential threat |

## War Finance: The North

### Revenue Sources

| Source | Amount | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Bonds | $2.6 billion | Jay Cooke mass-marketed them |
| Greenbacks | $450 million | First national paper currency |
| Taxes | $750 million | First income tax (3-5%) |
| Tariffs | $300 million | Raised significantly |

### Financial Innovations

| Innovation | Significance |
|------------|--------------|
| Greenbacks | National fiat currency |
| National Banking Act (1863) | Uniform banking system |
| Income tax | First direct federal tax on individuals |
| Bond marketing | Mass participation in government debt |

### Economic Mobilization

| Sector | War Impact |
|--------|------------|
| Railroads | Coordinated troop/supply movement |
| Manufacturing | Expanded capacity |
| Agriculture | Mechanization accelerated (labor shortage) |
| Finance | Centralized, nationalized |

---

## War Finance: The South

### Revenue Sources

| Source | Amount | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Bonds | ~$700 million | Hard to sell, paid in depreciating currency |
| Confederate currency | $1.5 billion+ | Massive inflation |
| Taxes | Minimal | States resisted, hard to collect |
| Impressment | Widespread | Seized goods, alienated population |

### The Inflation Crisis

| Year | Confederate $ to Gold $ |
|------|------------------------|
| 1861 | 1:1 |
| 1862 | 1.5:1 |
| 1863 | 20:1 |
| 1864 | 50:1 |
| 1865 | 100:1 (worthless) |

### Structural Weaknesses

| Problem | Consequence |
|---------|-------------|
| No industrial base | Couldn't produce weapons, supplies |
| Limited railroads | Poor logistics |
| Cotton embargo backfired | Lost revenue, didn't coerce Britain |
| Decentralized government | Couldn't mobilize effectively |

---

## The Blockade and Trade

### Union Blockade

| Feature | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| Coverage | 3,500 miles of coastline |
| Effectiveness | Improved from 10% to 90% interception |
| Confederate exports | Dropped 95% |
| Imports | Severe shortages |

### King Cotton Diplomacy

| Southern Expectation | Reality |
|---------------------|---------|
| Britain depends on cotton | Britain had stockpiles |
| Britain will intervene | Britain stayed neutral |
| Cotton = leverage | Moral opposition to slavery stronger |
| Economic coercion works | Egypt/India supplied alternatives |
