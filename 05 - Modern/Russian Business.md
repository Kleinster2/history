# Russian Business

Russian business emerged from the Soviet collapse through the most rapid and controversial privatization in history. In the chaos of the 1990s, a handful of oligarchs acquired the commanding heights of the Russian economy for a fraction of their value. Under Putin, the state reasserted control—not by nationalizing, but by making [[Property Rights|property rights]] conditional on political loyalty. The result is state capitalism with a distinctly Russian character: technically private ownership, but only at the pleasure of the Kremlin. Russian business shows what happens when markets are created before institutions: oligarchy, not competition.

## The Deeper Point

Russian business is the clearest demonstration that [[Property Rights|property rights]] without rule of law produces oligarchy, not competitive markets. The 1990s privatization created formal private ownership, but without the [[Institutions and Progress|institutional]] infrastructure—independent courts, secure contracts, consistent enforcement—that makes property rights meaningful. The oligarchs who acquired assets for pennies on the dollar understood that their ownership was never truly secure; their response was to extract maximum value quickly and park it abroad. Putin's reassertion of state control didn't establish rule of law; it established *rule of Putin*—property rights are secure so long as owners remain politically compliant. This is [[Varieties of Capitalism|state capitalism]] of a distinctive kind: not developmental (like Korea or China, directing private capital toward industrial goals) but *predatory* (extracting from private capital under threat of expropriation). [[Entrepreneurship|Entrepreneurial]] ambition is channeled not into production (why invest when it can be taken?) nor into market competition (why compete when connections matter more?) but into securing political protection and extracting what you can while you can. The Baumol thesis in its darkest form: in Russia, the most ambitious people become oligarchs, officials, or emigrate. The sanctions era adds a new layer: Russian business must now operate in isolation, cut off from the global institutional infrastructure (SWIFT, capital markets, technology) that it previously relied on. Whether this produces self-sufficient adaptation or long-term decline remains to be seen—but the institutional lesson is clear: markets without the institutional foundations of capitalism produce something that looks like capitalism but performs very differently.
