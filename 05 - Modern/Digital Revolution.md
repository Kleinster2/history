# Digital Revolution

The transistor (1947) began a transformation as profound as the Industrial Revolution. Computing power doubled every two years for seven decades, creating an entirely new economic sector and reshaping every old one. From mainframes to PCs, from internet to smartphones, from e-commerce to AI, digital technology promised a productivity revolution. Whether it delivered remains debated—but it certainly redistributed wealth, power, and employment.

## Overview

### The Transformation

## Electronics Foundations

### Key Inventions

| Invention | Date | Significance |
|-----------|------|--------------|
| Transistor | 1947 | Replaced vacuum tubes |
| Integrated circuit | 1958 | Multiple transistors on chip |
| Microprocessor | 1971 | Computer on a chip |
| DRAM | 1966 | Affordable memory |

### Moore's Law

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Observation | Transistors per chip double every ~2 years |
| Duration | 1965-2020s |
| Effect | Exponential improvement |
| Cost decline | Computing got 10 billion times cheaper |
| Status | Slowing physically, continuing economically |

### Military Origins

| Program | Contribution |
|---------|--------------|
| ENIAC | First programmable computer (1945) |
| ARPANET | Internet predecessor (1969) |
| GPS | Navigation satellite system |
| Semiconductors | Defense demand funded early industry |
| R&D | Government funded breakthrough research |

### Fairchild Semiconductor: The Startup That Spawned Silicon Valley (1957)

Eight engineers left Shockley Semiconductor (whose founder had co-invented the transistor) to start Fairchild—creating the template for everything Silicon Valley became:

| Innovation | Legacy |
|------------|--------|
| Integrated circuit (1959) | Noyce's planar IC—foundation of all modern chips |
| Venture-backed startup | Arthur Rock's investment model |
| Spin-off culture | "Leaving to start your own" became legitimate |
| Stock options | Engineers as equity owners |
| Meritocracy claims | Technical talent over corporate hierarchy |
| Spawn | Intel, AMD, National Semiconductor—65+ companies |

Fairchild's organizational DNA—VC funding, stock options, spin-off culture, engineer-founders—became the Silicon Valley model. Every tech startup today operates on the template these eight defectors created. The "Fairchildren" (companies spawned from Fairchild alumni) include Intel, AMD, and through them the entire semiconductor industry. See [[Foundational Firms]].

### Why Silicon Valley Beat Route 128

The East Coast had every advantage—yet lost. The contrast reveals how [[Institutions and Progress|institutional rules shape outcomes]]:

| Feature | Route 128 (Boston) | Silicon Valley |
|---------|-------------------|----------------|
| Research | MIT, Bell Labs, Harvard | Stanford (weaker initially) |
| Capital | Wall Street, defense contracts | Venture capital (newer, riskier) |
| Firm structure | Large, vertically integrated (DEC, Wang, Raytheon) | Small, networked, constantly splitting |
| Non-competes | Enforced—engineers locked in | California won't enforce—people move freely |
| Knowledge flow | Stays inside firms | Flows between firms via job-hopping |
| Failure | Career-ending stigma | Expected, tolerated, even valued |
| Culture | Corporate loyalty, hierarchy | Meritocracy claims, flat(ter) |

The decisive factor: California's refusal to enforce non-compete clauses meant that when Fairchild engineers left to start Intel (1968), no one could stop them. In Massachusetts, DEC and Wang kept talent trapped—and when those firms declined, the knowledge went down with them. Same talent, different legal rules, radically different innovation ecosystems.
