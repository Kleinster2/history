# Labor and Unions

Organized labor shaped 20th-century capitalism. When workers bargained collectively, they won higher wages, shorter hours, safer workplaces, and political power. The result was the prosperous middle class of the postwar era. Then globalization, deindustrialization, and political attack weakened unions, and inequality returned. The rise and decline of organized labor tracks the arc of shared prosperity.

## Overview

| 1900-1935 | Rising, contested | High |
| 1935-1973 | Peak power | Low (falling) |
| 1973-present | Declining | Rising |
