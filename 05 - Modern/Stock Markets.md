# Stock Markets

The stock market is capitalism's most visible institution—a real-time scoreboard of collective economic expectations. But equity markets are also a mechanism: they channel savings into investment, set the price of risk, allocate capital across industries, and distribute ownership. From the Amsterdam Beurs to algorithmic trading, stock markets evolved from niche merchant tools into the central nervous system of global capitalism. Their history is a story of innovation, speculation, crisis, and the growing dominance of financial logic over the real economy.
