# Danish Economic History

From agricultural kingdom to knowledge economy. Denmark's path shows how cooperative institutions, agricultural innovation, and labor market flexibility can produce prosperity without abundant natural resources.

## Agricultural Foundation (1800-1914)

### Land Reform Breakthrough

|--------|--------|
| 1780s-1800s | Peasant emancipation from landlords |

### Export Success

| Product | Market | Innovation |
|---------|--------|------------|
| Butter | Britain | Consistent quality, branding |

## The Deeper Point

Denmark transformed from agricultural periphery to knowledge economy through [[Institutions and Progress|institutional innovation]]. The cooperative movement showed that small farmers could achieve scale through organization rather than consolidation—creating a rural middle class instead of landlord dominance or peasant poverty.

The flexicurity model extended this logic to industrial labor markets: instead of protecting jobs, protect workers. Let firms adjust while ensuring people don't suffer. The result was labor markets that adapted to change rather than resisting it, with workers who accepted technological disruption because they had security.

Denmark's success challenges the assumption that small, resource-poor countries can't compete. With no oil, no large domestic market, and no industrial first-mover advantage, Denmark built prosperity through human capital, cooperation, and institutional design. The cooperative tradition, folk high schools, and flexicurity system all share a common logic: collective institutions enabling individual success.

This isn't socialism—Danish firms compete aggressively in global markets. It's a different [[Varieties of Capitalism|variety of capitalism]] where institutions channel competition toward productivity rather than a race to the bottom.
