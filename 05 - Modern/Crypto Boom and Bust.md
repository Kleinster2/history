# Crypto Boom and Bust

Digital gold or digital tulips. Cryptocurrency promised to remake money, finance, and the internet itself. Bitcoin emerged from the 2008 financial crisis as a libertarian dream—money without governments. Ethereum enabled "smart contracts" and spawned thousands of tokens. Believers saw a revolution; skeptics saw a speculative bubble. The 2022 collapse—$2 trillion in value destroyed, exchanges bankrupt, founders indicted—seemed to settle the debate. But Bitcoin recovered, spot ETFs launched, and crypto persists. Whether it's a transformative technology finding its footing or a speculation that refuses to die remains genuinely uncertain.

## The Deeper Point

Crypto is the purest test of the [[Speculative Bubbles|bubble]] question: when does speculation finance transformation, and when is it just speculation? The internet bubble of 2000 wasted capital on Pets.com but also funded the infrastructure Amazon and Google used. The crypto bubble funded... what?

The honest answer is: mostly speculation, but possibly something real. Bitcoin has survived four boom-bust cycles and may genuinely function as "digital gold" for some investors. Stablecoins have real utility—$130B circulating, trillions in transaction volume. DeFi protocols work, even if they mainly serve crypto traders. The question is whether these narrow use cases justify the attention and capital.

The [[Innovation Economics|innovation]] question is open. Blockchain technology might still find killer applications beyond speculation. But after 15 years, the "it's early" defense wears thin. The applications that work—speculation, stablecoins, some cross-border payments—might be all there is.

The institutional insight connects to [[American Business Strategy]]: crypto emerged from distrust of institutions (banks, governments, central banks) and proposed technology as a substitute. But FTX showed that removing institutional guardrails doesn't eliminate the need for trust—it just moves trust to unregulated actors who can steal your money. The old institutions (SEC, courts, laws) turned out to be necessary. The crypto industry is slowly rebuilding them (regulated exchanges, audited stablecoins, ETFs through existing financial infrastructure). Whether this is evolution toward legitimacy or abandonment of the original vision depends on your perspective.
