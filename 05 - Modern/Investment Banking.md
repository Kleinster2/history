# Investment Banking

Investment banking is the industry that channels capital to enterprise—or extracts rents from it. From the Rothschilds financing European sovereigns to Goldman Sachs advising on mega-mergers, investment banks have served as intermediaries between those with capital and those who need it. They underwrite securities, advise on mergers, trade for clients and themselves, and in the process have accumulated immense wealth and power. The industry's evolution—from merchant banking partnerships to global financial supermarkets to the post-2008 regulated giants—tracks the changing relationship between finance and the real economy.

## The Deeper Point

Investment banking demonstrates [[Entrepreneurship|Baumol's insight]] in finance: the same talent for deal-making, risk assessment, and capital deployment can be channeled toward productive investment or toward rent extraction, depending on [[Institutions and Progress|institutional]] incentives. When Morgan reorganized railroads, he imposed discipline that made them function; when 2000s investment banks packaged subprime mortgages into CDOs, they created systemic risk for fees. The partnership model constrained risk because partners' own wealth was at stake; the corporate model with implicit government backstop ("too big to fail") invited excessive leverage. [[Business Regulation]] through Glass-Steagall channeled banks away from speculation; its repeal reopened those channels. The industry's evolution—from relationship banking to transaction machines to post-crisis utilities—reflects changing social contracts about what finance is for. The current model (universal banks, heavy regulation, constrained prop trading) represents a political settlement: keep the capital-channeling function, limit the casino. Whether this lasts depends on whether the next crisis reveals new failure modes. Investment banks remain essential intermediaries for [[Creative Destruction]]—but whether they enable it or extract from it depends on rules they've proven adept at influencing.
