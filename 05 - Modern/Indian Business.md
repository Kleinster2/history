# Indian Business

Indian business evolved through three distinct systems: the managing agency under the British Raj (colonial capitalism serving imperial interests), the diversified business house under the license raj (family conglomerates navigating state controls), and the liberalized firm after 1991 (globally competitive, especially in IT services). Each phase produced organizational innovations adapted to its constraints. The Indian business story demonstrates how [[Institutions and Progress|institutional environments]] shape what firms become—and how entrepreneurial talent finds channels even in hostile conditions.

## Overview

### Three Phases

| Phase | Period | Character |
|-------|--------|-----------|
| Colonial | 1850-1947 | Managing agencies, imperial extraction |
| License Raj | 1947-1991 | Diversified houses, state controls |
| Liberalized | 1991-present | Global competition, IT, startups |

### The Big Business Houses

| Group | Founded | Core Sectors |

## Colonial Business (1850-1947)

| Role | Finance, management, marketing for many firms |
| Advantage | Scarce managerial talent spread across ventures |
| Problem | Conflicts of interest, extraction |

### British vs. Indian Business

| Managing agencies (Jardine, Inchcape) | Family partnerships |
| Export-oriented (jute, tea, indigo) | Domestic market (textiles, steel) |
| Imperial connections | Nationalist connections |
| Declining post-independence | Growing post-independence |

### Tata: The Pioneer

| Achievement | Date | Significance |
|-------------|------|--------------|
| Empress Mills (textiles) | 1877 | Competed with Manchester |
| Tata Steel (TISCO) | 1907 | First Indian steel (before most of Asia) |
| Tata Power | 1911 | Hydroelectric for Bombay |
| Indian Institute of Science | 1909 | Research university (philanthropy) |
| Tata Airlines | 1932 | Became Air India |
| Philosophy | Industry for nation-building |

### The Birla Model

## License Raj Business (1947-1991)

### The System

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Industrial licensing | Government permission needed for any expansion |
| Import controls | Protect domestic industry |
| Price controls | Government sets prices |
| Foreign investment restricted | Keep multinationals out |
| MRTP Act | Limits on large firms (monopoly prevention) |
| Result | Scarcity economy, rent-seeking |

### How Business Houses Adapted

| Constraint | Strategy |
|------------|----------|
| Can't expand in one industry | Diversify into everything |
| Can't import technology | Develop indigenous capability |
| Licenses scarce | Lobby, connections, family networks |
| Capital controls | Internal financing, family capital |
| Slow bureaucracy | Patience, relationship-building |

### The Diversified Conglomerate

| Why It Made Sense | Mechanism |
|-------------------|-----------|
| Each license is a monopoly | Collect as many as possible |
| Capital scarce | Fund new ventures internally |
| Talent scarce | Deploy managers across group |
| Uncertainty high | Diversification as insurance |
| Result | Groups in steel, textiles, chemicals, finance, hotels, media |

### The Cost

| Problem | Evidence |
|---------|----------|
| Low productivity | "Hindu rate of growth" (3.5%/year) |
| No competition | No pressure to improve |
| No exports | Products not competitive globally |
| Innovation suppressed | No reward for better products |
| Corruption | License = rent-seeking opportunity |
| Consumers last | Shoddy goods, long waits (Ambassador car) |

## Liberalization (1991-present)

### The 1991 Crisis and Reforms

| Reform | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Licensing abolished | Firms can expand freely |
| Import liberalization | Competition arrives |

| Result | GDP growth doubled (7%+) |

### Winners and Losers

| Winners | Losers |
|---------|--------|
| Competitive firms (Tata, Infosys) | Protected firms (many closed) |
| Export-oriented | Import-competing |
| New entrepreneurs | Old license holders |
| Consumers | Bureaucratic rent-seekers |
| Service sector | Some manufacturing |

## Debates

|--------|-------------------|----------------------|
| Demographics | Young population | Undereducated masses |
