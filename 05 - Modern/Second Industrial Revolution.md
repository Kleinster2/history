# Second Industrial Revolution

The First [[Industrial Revolution]] ran on steam, iron, and textiles. The Second ran on electricity, steel, and chemicals—and it created the modern business world. Between 1870 and 1914, a cluster of radical innovations transformed not just production but organization: railroads demanded professional management, electricity redesigned factories, telecommunications enabled coordination across continents, and chemistry created entirely new industries. This was the technological foundation on which [[Corporate Evolution|modern corporations]], [[Mass Production]], and the [[Gilded Age|Gilded Age economy]] were built.

## Overview
