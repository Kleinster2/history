# Information Technology as Infrastructure

Each information revolution enabled larger-scale organization. Printing spread knowledge beyond scribal copying; the telegraph transmitted information faster than goods could move; the telephone enabled voice coordination; radio broadcast to millions; the internet created networks of networks. Information technology is not just about communication—it's about coordination. The ability to coordinate over distance and time is what enables complex organizations, markets, and economic systems.

## Overview

| Revolution | Technology | Effect |
|------------|------------|--------|
| Printing (1450s) | Movable type | Knowledge diffusion |
| Telegraph (1840s) | Electric signals | Instant communication |
| Telephone (1870s) | Voice transmission | Personal communication |
| Radio/TV (1900s) | Broadcast | Mass communication |
| Internet (1990s) | Networks | Global, interactive |

## The Deeper Point

Information technology is [[Institutions and Progress|infrastructure for coordination]]. Each revolution expanded the scale at which humans could organize. Printing enabled knowledge to accumulate across generations without loss in copying. The telegraph let information move faster than goods—which transformed arbitrage, news, and management. The telephone enabled voice coordination at distance. Radio and television created mass audiences. The internet connected everything to everything. The pattern: each breakthrough enabled organizations and markets to operate at larger scale because coordination became easier. The [[Corporate Evolution|modern corporation]] is impossible without telecommunications—you can't manage global operations by letter. [[Global Supply Chains]] are impossible without instant communication—you can't coordinate just-in-time production across continents by telegraph. The [[Digital Revolution]] isn't just about new products; it's about radically cheaper coordination. When coordination costs fall, organizations can be larger, markets can be broader, and specialization can be deeper. Information technology doesn't just transmit messages—it enables the complex economic systems that produce modern prosperity.
