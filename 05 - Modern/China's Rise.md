# China's Rise

China's economic transformation since 1978 is the most significant economic event since the Industrial Revolution. A quarter of humanity moved from poverty to middle-income status in a single generation. China became the world's factory, largest exporter, and second-largest economy. This wasn't capitalism or socialism but something new—"socialism with Chinese characteristics"—that defied Western categories.

### What It Means

China's rise reversed the Great Divergence—for the first time in 200 years, Asia's share of global GDP is returning to historical norms. Whether China completes the transition to high-income status, and what its rise means for the global order, are the defining questions of the 21st century.

## The Deeper Point

China's rise is the greatest [[Institutions and Progress|institutional]] experiment of the 21st century: can a country sustain growth without the rule of law, independent courts, free press, or democratic accountability that institutional economics considers essential? The record so far is a qualified yes—but with a crucial caveat. China's [[Property Rights|property rights]] are insecure by Western standards, yet investment flows because the Party credibly commits to not expropriating *productive* assets (while freely seizing unproductive ones). This selective enforcement creates powerful incentives for investment over rent-seeking—Baumol's thesis achieved through authoritarian discretion rather than legal constraint. Every previous authoritarian development miracle (Japan, Korea, Taiwan) eventually required political liberalization to sustain [[Innovation Economics|innovation]] at the technological frontier, where creative destruction threatens incumbent interests that authoritarian systems protect. Whether China breaks this pattern—achieving frontier innovation without institutional liberalization—or confirms it, is the defining question of our era. The answer will determine whether the Great Divergence was a one-time Western accident or whether certain institutional features are genuinely prerequisite for sustained progress.
