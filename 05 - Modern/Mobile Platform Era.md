# Mobile Platform Era

The smartphone ate the world. Between 2007 and 2015, computing shifted from desk to pocket, creating new giants (app developers, social platforms), destroying old ones (Nokia, BlackBerry, camera makers, GPS companies), and concentrating power in two platform owners: Apple and Google. The mobile era didn't just add a new device category—it reorganized daily life around always-connected, location-aware, camera-equipped computers that people carry everywhere.

## Before the iPhone

### The Mobile Landscape (2006)

| Player | Position |
|--------|----------|
| Nokia | 40% global market share |
| Motorola | RAZR success, ~20% share |
| Samsung | Rising, feature phones |
| BlackBerry | Business dominance, email |
| Palm | PDA pioneer, fading |
| Microsoft | Windows Mobile, modest share |

### What "Smartphone" Meant

| Feature | Pre-iPhone Smartphone |
|---------|----------------------|
| Input | Physical keyboard or stylus |
| Apps | Carrier-controlled, limited |
| Browser | "Mobile web"—stripped down |
| Interface | Designed for one-handed operation |
| Target | Business users |

### The Limitations

| Constraint | Reality |
|------------|---------|
| Carriers controlled | Phones, apps, services |
| Closed ecosystems | No third-party apps (mostly) |
| Poor browsers | Couldn't use real web |
| Clunky interfaces | Stylus, menus, complexity |
| Business focus | Consumer smartphones barely existed |

**Why Nokia Failed**

| Factor | Mechanism |
|--------|-----------|
| Symbian | Legacy OS couldn't compete |

| 2008 | Still growing, business dominance |
| 2010 | Consumers abandoning |
| 2011 | Outage crisis, reputation damage |
| 2013 | BBM cross-platform, too late |
| 2016 | Exits hardware manufacturing |

**Why BlackBerry Failed**

| Factor | Mechanism |
|--------|-----------|
| Keyboard attachment | Touch seen as threat to differentiator |
| Enterprise focus | Didn't see consumer shift |
| App ecosystem | Developers didn't come |
| Touch attempts | Storm (2008) was terrible |
| Management | Co-CEOs, slow decisions |

### Casualties Beyond Phones

## The Deeper Point

The mobile platform era demonstrates how platform transitions create new winners while destroying incumbents—even those who see the change coming. Nokia had touch-screen prototypes before the iPhone shipped. BlackBerry's engineers knew keyboards would decline. Both companies understood the threat and still couldn't respond because organizational structure and culture prevented adaptation.

The institutional insight connects to [[Tech Industry Winners and Losers]]: incumbents fail not from blindness but from *rational* responses to their existing business. Nokia's carriers wanted cheaper phones. BlackBerry's enterprise customers wanted keyboards. Serving current customers meant failing future ones. Only companies willing to cannibalize themselves—Apple with the iPhone eating the iPod—navigated the transition.

The platform economics that emerged became even more concentrated than the [[PC Revolution]]. Where PCs had Microsoft and Intel sharing dominance with PC makers capturing some value, mobile concentrated power in platform owners (Apple, Google) and a few giant apps (Facebook, Google services). The 70/30 app store split became an industry standard that transferred enormous value from developers to platform owners.

By 2015, the mobile transformation was essentially complete: computing had moved to the pocket, two platforms controlled the ecosystem, and the giants of the next era (Facebook, Uber, Airbnb) had emerged. The [[Silicon Valley Model]] had produced its most concentrated value creation yet—and set the stage for debates about platform power that continue today.
