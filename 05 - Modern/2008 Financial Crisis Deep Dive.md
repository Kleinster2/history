# 2008 Financial Crisis Deep Dive

The crisis that revealed systemic fragility. 2008 revealed how financial innovation without [[Institutions and Progress|institutional adaptation]] creates systemic risk—complexity outran regulation.

## Origins: The Housing Bubble

### What Inflated It

| Factor | Mechanism |
|--------|-----------|
| Low interest rates | Fed funds at 1% (2003) |
| Mortgage innovation | Subprime, Alt-A, no-doc |
| Securitization | Risk "distributed" |
| Credit rating failure | AAA on junk |
| Global savings glut | Foreign capital seeking yield |

### Housing Price Rise

| Year | National Price Index (Case-Shiller) |
|------|-------------------------------------|
| 2000 | 100 |
| 2003 | 124 |
| 2005 | 175 |
| 2006 | 189 (peak) |
| 2009 | 129 (trough) |

### Mortgage Deterioration

| Loan Type | Share of Originations |
|-----------|----------------------|
| Prime | Declining |
| Subprime | 8% (2003) → 20% (2006) |
| Alt-A | Growing rapidly |
| No-doc/Liar loans | Increasingly common |

## The Machine: Securitization

### How It Worked

| Step | Process |
|------|---------|
| 1 | Originator makes mortgage |
| 2 | Sells to aggregator |
| 3 | Pooled into RMBS |
| 4 | Tranched (senior, mezzanine, equity) |
| 5 | Rated by agencies |
| 6 | Sold to investors |
| 7 | Mezzanine → CDO → CDO² |

### The Alchemy

| Input | Output |
|-------|--------|
| Subprime mortgages (B-rated) | AAA-rated securities |
| "Diversification" | Correlated failure ignored |
| Complex tranching | Opacity |
| Models | Assumed no national price decline |

### Who Bought It

| Buyer | Motivation |
|-------|------------|
| Banks | Yield, capital arbitrage |
| Insurance companies | Ratings-based investing |
| Pension funds | "Safe" yield |
| Money market funds | Repo collateral |
| Foreign investors | AAA in dollars |

## Leverage and Shadow Banking

### Investment Bank Leverage

| Bank | Leverage Ratio (2007) |
|------|----------------------|
| Bear Stearns | 33:1 |
| Lehman Brothers | 31:1 |
| Morgan Stanley | 33:1 |
| Merrill Lynch | 28:1 |
| Goldman Sachs | 26:1 |

### Shadow Banking

## Rating Agency Failure

### The Conflict

| Problem | Consequence |
|---------|-------------|
| Issuer pays | Incentive to please |
| Competition | "Rating shopping" |
| Fee structure | More complex = more fees |
| Models | Relied on issuer data |

### What Went Wrong

| Rated | Reality |
|-------|---------|
| AAA securities | Defaulted massively |
| Subprime MBS | 93% of 2006 AAA → junk by 2009 |
| CDOs | Nearly total collapse |
| Monolines | All downgraded |

## The Deeper Point

2008 revealed how financial innovation without [[Institutions and Progress|institutional adaptation]] creates systemic risk—complexity outran regulation. The same institutions that enabled efficient capital allocation (securitization, derivatives, rating agencies) became transmission mechanisms for collapse when the underlying assets failed.

The crisis illustrates a fundamental institutional challenge: financial systems evolve faster than regulation. Securitization, credit default swaps, and structured products emerged in the gaps between regulatory jurisdictions. Shadow banking grew precisely because it avoided capital requirements. Rating agencies operated under incentive structures that rewarded volume over accuracy.

The post-crisis response followed the historical pattern: crises produce reform. Just as the [[Great Depression Deep Dive|Great Depression]] created the FDIC, SEC, and Glass-Steagall, the 2008 crisis created Dodd-Frank, living wills, and stress tests. Whether these reforms are sufficient for the next crisis remains unknown—the next crisis typically exploits different vulnerabilities.

The 2008 experience suggests that [[Behavioral Economics|human psychology]] interacts with [[Institutional Economics|institutional design]] in dangerous ways. The same biases—overconfidence, herding, short-termism—that create bubbles also infect the institutions (rating agencies, regulators, banks) that are supposed to prevent them. Institutions staffed by humans with human biases face limits that no regulatory design can fully overcome.
