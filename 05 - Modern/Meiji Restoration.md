# Meiji Restoration

The Meiji Restoration transformed Japan from a feudal backwater into an industrial power in a single generation. After 250 years of isolation, Japan opened to the world in 1853 and faced a choice: modernize or be colonized. The Meiji oligarchs chose modernization—importing Western technology, institutions, and ideas while preserving Japanese identity. By 1905, Japan defeated Russia, announcing its arrival as a great power.
