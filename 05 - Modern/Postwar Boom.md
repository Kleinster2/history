# Postwar Boom

The postwar boom—sometimes called the "Golden Age of Capitalism"—was the greatest period of sustained economic growth in human history. From 1945 to 1973, the United States and Western Europe achieved near-full employment, rising wages, expanding middle classes, and material abundance that would have seemed utopian a generation earlier. This era created the world we still largely inhabit.

## The Numbers in Perspective

### Growth Comparison

| Era | US Annual Growth |
|-----|------------------|
| 1870-1913 | 4.0% |
| 1913-1950 | 2.8% |

| 1973-2000 | 3.0% |
| 2000-2019 | 2.0% |

### Why It Matters

The postwar boom set expectations—for rising wages, expanding homeownership, upward mobility—that became the American Dream. When growth slowed after 1973, the gap between expectations and reality created the political tensions that still shape our world.

## The Deeper Point

The postwar boom wasn't natural—it was institutionally constructed. Bretton Woods, GATT, the GI Bill, union contracts, the welfare state: all were deliberate responses to the interwar catastrophe. The result was the only sustained period in capitalist history when median wages rose as fast as productivity—not because markets naturally distribute gains broadly, but because [[Institutions and Progress|institutions]] forced them to. When those institutions eroded (floating exchange rates after 1971, deregulation after 1980, union decline, globalization of supply chains), growth continued but gains concentrated at the top. The boom proves that growth and equality aren't inherent trade-offs—they're both products of institutional design. The era's end also proves that institutional frameworks don't persist automatically; they require the political conditions (labor power, Cold War competition, Depression memory) that created them. Remove those conditions and the institutions unravel, no matter how well they performed.
