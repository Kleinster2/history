# Keynesian Revolution

In 1936, John Maynard Keynes published *The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money* and changed how governments manage economies. Before Keynes, orthodoxy said markets self-correct—unemployment would fix itself. Keynes showed it wouldn't necessarily, and that government spending could restore demand. This idea built the postwar prosperity, shaped institutions from the Fed to the welfare state, and remains the framework policymakers reach for in every crisis.

## Overview

### The Revolution

| Before Keynes | After Keynes |
|---------------|--------------|
| Markets self-correct | They can get stuck |
| Government should balance budgets | Deficits appropriate in recession |
| Unemployment is voluntary | Can be involuntary |
| Say's Law (supply creates demand) | Demand can be deficient |
| Central banks only | Fiscal policy matters too |

## The General Theory

### Core Ideas

| Concept | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| Effective demand | Total spending determines output |
| Liquidity preference | Why people hold money |
| Marginal efficiency of capital | Expected investment returns |
| Multiplier | Spending creates more spending |
| Animal spirits | Confidence drives investment |

### The Multiplier

| Mechanism | Process |
|-----------|---------|
| Government spends $1 | Creates income |
| Recipients spend portion | Creates more income |
| Cascading effect | Total impact > initial spend |
| Size | Depends on saving rate |
| Example | $1 spent → $1.50-3.00 total GDP impact |

### Why Unemployment Persists

| Classical View | Keynesian View |
|----------------|----------------|
| Wages too high | Demand too low |
| Cut wages → employment | Cut wages → less spending → less demand |
| Individual logic | Fallacy of composition |
| Solution: flexibility | Solution: stimulate demand |

### The Paradox of Thrift

| Logic | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| One person saves more | Prudent |
| Everyone saves more | Demand falls |
| Output contracts | Less income to save from |
| Paradox | Individual virtue = collective vice |

## How Keynesianism Became Policy

### The War Proved It

| Evidence | Mechanism |
|----------|-----------|
| 1930s deficit spending | Partial recovery (New Deal) |
| 1937 austerity | Caused recession |
| WWII spending | Ended Depression completely |
| Conclusion | Government spending works |

### The Postwar Consensus

| Country | Implementation |
|---------|----------------|
| US | Employment Act (1946), full employment goal |
| UK | Beveridge Report, welfare state |
| France | Indicative planning |
| Germany | Social market (modified) |
| Japan | Industrial policy (extended) |

### Bretton Woods System

| Keynes's Role | Contribution |
|---------------|--------------|
| Designed framework | International monetary order |
| Bancor | Proposed world currency |
| Clearing union | Symmetric adjustment |
| Reality | US-dominated version adopted |
| Legacy | IMF, World Bank, fixed-but-adjustable rates |

---

## The Keynesian Toolkit

### Fiscal Policy

| Tool | Use |
|------|-----|
| Government spending | Direct demand creation |
| Tax cuts | Indirect (increase disposable income) |
| Automatic stabilizers | Unemployment insurance, progressive taxes |
| Discretionary | Active intervention |

### Monetary Policy

| Tool | Use |
|------|-----|
| Interest rates | Influence investment |
| But | Liquidity trap possible (rates can't go below zero) |
| Keynes's view | Fiscal more reliable than monetary |
| Postwar practice | Both used together |

### The IS-LM Model (Hicks, 1937)

| Component | Represents |
|-----------|------------|
| IS curve | Goods market equilibrium |
| LM curve | Money market equilibrium |
| Intersection | Overall equilibrium |
| Policy analysis | Shift curves with fiscal/monetary policy |
| Status | Textbook Keynesianism for decades |

---

## The Keynesian Golden Age (1945-1973)

### What It Achieved

| Measure | Performance |
|---------|-------------|
| Growth | 4-5% annually (OECD) |
| Unemployment | 2-3% (full employment) |
| Inflation | Low and stable |
| Recessions | Mild and short |
| Living standards | Doubled in a generation |

### Fine-Tuning

| Concept | Practice |
|---------|----------|
| Countercyclical policy | Spend in recession, save in boom |
| Phillips Curve | Trade-off: unemployment vs. inflation |
| Full employment target | Priority of policy |
| Demand management | Adjust to maintain output |

### The Phillips Curve

| Relationship | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| Low unemployment | Higher inflation |
| High unemployment | Lower inflation |
| Trade-off | Policymakers choose point |
| Stable | Seemed reliable (1950s-60s) |
| Breakdown | 1970s—both rose together |

---

## The Crisis of Keynesianism (1970s)

### Stagflation

| Problem | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Inflation | Rising (10%+) |
| Unemployment | Also rising |
| Impossible | Phillips Curve said can't happen |
| Cause | Oil shocks + wage-price spirals |

### The Critique

| Critic | Argument |
|--------|----------|
| Friedman | Expectations-augmented Phillips Curve; no long-run trade-off |
| Lucas | Rational expectations; policy ineffective |
| Hayek | Government intervention causes distortions |
| Public choice | Politicians always spend (deficit bias) |

### Friedman's Monetarism

| Idea | Implication |
|------|-------------|
| Inflation = monetary phenomenon | Control money supply |
| Natural rate of unemployment | Can't stay below it |
| Rules over discretion | Steady money growth |
| Expectations | People anticipate policy |
| Influence | Fed under Volcker (1979-82) |

### The New Classical Revolution

| Thinker | Contribution |
|---------|--------------|
| Lucas | Rational expectations |
| Sargent | Policy ineffectiveness proposition |
| Barro | Ricardian equivalence |
| Prescott | Real business cycles |
| Implication | Active fiscal policy useless |

## Keynesianism Transformed

### New Keynesianism (1980s-2000s)

| Innovation | Contribution |
|------------|--------------|
| Price stickiness | Why markets don't clear |
| Menu costs | Small frictions, big effects |
| Coordination failures | Multiple equilibria |
| Credit constraints | Financial frictions |
| Result | Micro-founded Keynesianism |

### The New Consensus (1990s-2008)

| Principle | Practice |
|-----------|----------|
| Monetary policy primary | Interest rates manage demand |
| Fiscal policy secondary | Automatic stabilizers only |
| Central bank independence | Credibility |
| Inflation targeting | 2% target |
| "Great Moderation" | Believed problem solved |

---

## The Return (2008-Present)

### 2008 Crisis

| Response | Keynesian |
|----------|-----------|
| Fiscal stimulus | US: $800 billion, global: $2 trillion |
| Monetary easing | Zero rates, QE |
| Argument | Without stimulus, depression |
| Evidence | Countries that stimulated recovered faster |

### Austerity Debate

| View | Argument |
|------|----------|
| Keynesian | Austerity in recession = self-defeating |
| Austerian | Debt unsustainable, confidence |
| Europe | Austerity worsened crisis |
| IMF | Admitted multipliers were larger than assumed |

### COVID Response (2020)

| Action | Scale |
|--------|-------|
| Government spending | Trillions worldwide |
| Direct payments | To households |
| Business support | Payroll protection |
| Result | Sharp recovery (but inflation followed) |
| Lesson? | Keynesian response can overshoot |

### Modern Monetary Theory (MMT)

| Claim | Mainstream Response |
|-------|---------------------|
| Government can't go broke | Technically true (own currency) |
| Spend until inflation | Too simple |
| Deficits don't matter (mostly) | Heterodox |
| Jobs guarantee | Debated |
| Status | Fringe but influential |

---

## Keynes's Legacy

### What Survived

| Idea | Status |
|------|--------|
| Demand matters | Universal acceptance |
| Government can stabilize | Practiced in every crisis |
| Automatic stabilizers | Permanent feature |
| Animal spirits | Recognized |
| Liquidity traps | Rediscovered (Japan, 2008) |

### What Didn't

| Idea | Status |
|------|--------|
| Fine-tuning | Abandoned |
| Phillips Curve trade-off | Modified heavily |
| Fiscal policy primacy | Monetary took over |
| Full employment guarantee | Weakened |

### The Cycle

| Pattern | Observation |
|---------|-------------|
| Crisis | Everyone's a Keynesian |
| Recovery | Orthodoxy reasserts |
| Stability | Complacency grows |
| Next crisis | Keynesian response again |
| Friedman (misattributed) | "We are all Keynesians now" |

## The Deeper Point

Keynes discovered that economies are institutionally constructed, not naturally self-organizing—that markets can get stuck in stable but suboptimal equilibria where involuntary unemployment persists indefinitely because no individual actor has the incentive or ability to restart the system. This is the macroeconomic parallel to Baumol's microeconomic insight: just as individual [[Entrepreneurship|entrepreneurial]] talent requires [[Institutions and Progress|institutional]] channeling to become productive, aggregate demand requires institutional management to prevent catastrophic coordination failures. The [[Great Depression]] proved it empirically: millions of willing workers, idle factories, unmet needs—and no market mechanism to reconnect them. The [[2008 Financial Crisis]] confirmed it when every government on earth, regardless of ideology, reached for Keynesian tools (stimulus, bailouts, central bank intervention) because the alternative was systemic collapse. The deeper implication challenges the vault's institutional thesis at its foundation: if getting the microeconomic institutions right ([[Property Rights|property rights]], [[Creative Destruction|competition]], open entry) isn't sufficient to prevent macroeconomic disaster, then [[State Capacity|state capacity]] for demand management is itself a prerequisite for sustained growth—not a supplement to good institutions but a *component* of them. The Keynesian Revolution's lasting contribution isn't any specific policy tool; it's the recognition that the economy is an institutional artifact requiring active maintenance, not a natural system requiring only non-interference. The cycle—crisis validates Keynes, recovery forgets him—isn't irony; it's the institutional version of [[Debt History|Minsky's]] instability hypothesis: successful stabilization breeds the complacency that undoes it.
