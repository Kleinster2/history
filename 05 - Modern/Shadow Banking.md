# Shadow Banking

Banking without banks—or without bank regulation. The shadow banking system grew to rival and then exceed traditional banking, providing credit intermediation outside regulatory frameworks. When the music stopped in 2008, shadow banks couldn't access the Fed's lender-of-last-resort function, and the system froze.

## What Is Shadow Banking?

### Definition

| Feature | Character |
|---------|-----------|
| Credit intermediation | Like banks |
| Maturity transformation | Borrow short, lend long |
| Leverage | Like banks |
| Regulation | Unlike banks (minimal) |
| Safety net | No deposit insurance, no Fed |

### Why "Shadow"?

| Aspect | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| Outside regulation | Bank rules don't apply |
| Opacity | Hard to see, measure |
| Parallel | Performs bank functions |
| Connected | Links to regulated banks |

### The Basic Activities

| Function | Shadow Version |
|----------|----------------|
| Deposits | Money market funds |
| Loans | Securitization, repo |
| Reserves | No requirements |
| Capital | Minimal |

## Key Components

### Money Market Funds

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Invented | 1971 |
| Function | Short-term investment |
| Return | Higher than bank deposits |
| NAV | Stable $1 (supposedly) |
| Insurance | None |

### How MMFs Work

| Mechanism | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| Collect savings | From individuals, corporations |
| Invest in short-term paper | Commercial paper, repo |
| Pay interest | Higher than banks |
| Promise liquidity | Withdraw anytime |
| Risk | If assets fall, redemptions run |

### The Reserve Primary Fund (2008)

| Event | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| Held Lehman paper | $785 million |
| Lehman failed | Paper worthless |
| NAV "broke the buck" | Fell below $1 |
| Run | $300 billion fled MMFs in days |
| Result | Treasury guarantee, Fed facilities |

## Repo Markets

### Repurchase Agreements

| Mechanism | Function |
|-----------|----------|
| Sell securities | With agreement to repurchase |
| Effectively | Short-term collateralized loan |
| Rates | Below unsecured |
| Scale | Trillions daily |

### Tri-Party Repo

| Feature | Character |
|---------|-----------|
| Clearingbank | Intermediary (JPM, BNY) |
| Scale | $2.5 trillion+ |
| Daily unwind | Every morning |
| Systemic risk | Concentration |

### The Repo Run (2008)

| Mechanism | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| Counterparty fear | Who's exposed to subprime? |
| Haircuts rise | More collateral required |
| Funding withdrawn | Dealers can't finance |
| Fire sales | Selling drives prices down |
| Spiral | Self-reinforcing |

## Securitization

### The Originate-to-Distribute Model

| Step | Function |
|------|----------|
| Originate | Bank makes loan |
| Package | Pool loans into securities |
| Sell | To investors |
| Result | Risk transferred (supposedly) |

### Mortgage-Backed Securities

| Type | Structure |
|------|-----------|
| Agency MBS | Fannie, Freddie guarantee |
| Private-label MBS | No government guarantee |
| CDOs | Repackaged MBS |
| Synthetic CDOs | CDS on MBS |

### The Problem

| Issue | Reality |
|-------|---------|
| "Skin in game" | Originators sold risk |
| Quality | Incentive to lend poorly |
| Complexity | Nobody understood |
| Ratings | AAA on junk |

## Structured Investment Vehicles (SIVs)

### What They Were

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Off-balance-sheet | Banks created but didn't consolidate |
| Funding | Commercial paper (short-term) |
| Assets | Longer-term, higher-yielding |
| Arbitrage | Maturity transformation |

### The Problem

| Vulnerability | Consequence |
|---------------|-------------|
| Maturity mismatch | Borrow 30-day, hold 5-year |
| No insurance | No deposit guarantee |
| No Fed access | Can't borrow in crisis |
| Sponsor risk | Banks had implicit commitment |

### The Collapse

| Event | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| Subprime concerns | Investors flee |
| Commercial paper market freezes | Can't roll over |
| SIVs fail | $400 billion |
| Banks absorb | On-balance-sheet again |

## The Scale

### Shadow Banking vs. Traditional (2007)

| System | Size |
|--------|------|
| Traditional banking | $10 trillion |
| Shadow banking | $12 trillion |
| Money market funds | $3.5 trillion |
| Repo | $2.5 trillion |
| Asset-backed commercial paper | $1.2 trillion |

### Why It Grew

| Driver | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Regulation | Banks had capital requirements |
| Returns | Shadow paid more |
| Innovation | New products |
| Demand | Institutional cash needed parking |
| Low rates | Reach for yield |

## The 2008 Freeze

### The Mechanism

| Stage | Event |
|-------|-------|
| Subprime defaults rise | Underlying assets deteriorate |
| Uncertainty | Who holds bad paper? |
| Counterparty fear | Don't trust anyone |
| Funding withdrawal | Repo, commercial paper dry up |
| Fire sales | Must sell assets |
| Price collapse | Self-reinforcing |

### Key Moments

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| August 2007 | BNP Paribas freezes funds |
| March 2008 | Bear Stearns run |
| September 15, 2008 | Lehman bankruptcy |
| September 16, 2008 | Reserve Primary breaks buck |
| September 2008 | System freeze |

### Why Traditional Tools Failed

| Problem | Reality |
|---------|---------|
| Not banks | Fed designed for banks |
| No deposit insurance | Nothing to protect |
| No capital requirements | Couldn't absorb losses |
| Interconnected | But separate from safety net |

## Fed Intervention

### Emergency Facilities

| Facility | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| PDCF | Lend to investment banks |
| AMLF | Support money market funds |
| CPFF | Buy commercial paper |
| TALF | Support securitization |

### What It Took

| Action | Scale |

| Lender of last resort | Extended to non-banks |
| Market maker of last resort | Fed bought assets |
| Scale | Trillions |
| Precedent | Permanent? |

| FSOC | Monitor systemic risk |
| "Too big to fail" | Resolution authority |
| Volcker Rule | Limit proprietary trading |
| Disclosure | More transparency |

### Money Market Reform (2016)

| Change | Effect |

|--------|-------|
| Minimal oversight | More monitoring |
| No capital | Some requirements |
| Opaque | More disclosure |
| Implicit safety net | Made explicit |

### What Didn't

| Persistence | Reason |
|-------------|--------|
| Shadow system exists | Demand remains |
| Risk migration | New forms emerge |
| Complexity | Still opaque |
| Scale | Still large |

## Contemporary Shadow Banking

### Current Forms

| Vehicle | Status |
|---------|--------|
| Money market funds | Reformed, $5 trillion+ |
| Repo | Still huge |
| CLOs | Collateralized loan obligations |
| Private credit | Growing rapidly |
| Stablecoins | Crypto shadow banking? |

### Private Credit Boom

| Development | Scale |
|-------------|-------|
| Direct lending | PE credit funds |
| Size | $1.5 trillion+ |
| Regulation | Minimal |
| Risk | Concentrated, opaque |

## The Deeper Point

Shadow banking revealed that [[Institutions and Progress|institutional]] boundaries around "banking" were arbitrary and incomplete. Banks were regulated because they performed maturity transformation—borrowing short, lending long—which creates fragility. But money market funds, repo markets, and SIVs performed the same function without the same regulation or safety net.

The crisis showed that banking is defined by function, not form. Any institution that borrows short and lends long is a bank, whether called that or not. The safety net—deposit insurance, lender of last resort—exists because maturity transformation is inherently fragile. Extending bank-like activities beyond the safety net creates systemic risk that eventually lands back on the public sector anyway.

The [[Financialization|financialization]] lesson is that financial innovation often involves regulatory arbitrage—performing regulated functions in unregulated forms. Shadow banking grew because it could offer higher returns by avoiding capital requirements and insurance costs. But it could offer those returns only because it was implicitly backed by the same safety net it didn't pay for. When crisis hit, the Fed extended support anyway.

The deeper institutional question is whether the safety net should follow the function wherever it goes, or whether certain functions should be restricted to regulated entities. Post-2008 reforms tried partial answers—more oversight, some restrictions—but shadow banking persists because the demand for bank-like services exceeds what regulated banks can profitably supply. The boundary between regulated and shadow banking remains contested institutional terrain.
