# Interwar Economy

The interwar period (1918-1939) was the hinge of modern economic history. In two decades, the world lurched from war debts to hyperinflation, from a fragile boom to catastrophic depression, from free trade to autarky. Every mistake made—reparations, the gold standard's return, protectionism, austerity during deflation—taught lessons that shaped postwar institutions. The interwar was a laboratory of failure that produced the [[Keynesian Revolution]] and the [[Postwar Boom]].

## Overview

### The Instability

| Period | Character |
|--------|-----------|
| 1918-1923 | Chaos (inflation, revolution, reparations) |
| 1924-1929 | Fragile stability (gold standard, boom) |
| 1929-1933 | Collapse ([[Great Depression]]) |
| 1933-1939 | Recovery, rearmament, autarky |

### What Went Wrong
