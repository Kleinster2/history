# ASEAN Economy

The Association of Southeast Asian Nations transformed from a Cold War security grouping into one of the world's most dynamic economic regions. With 680 million people and combined GDP of $3.6 trillion, ASEAN became a manufacturing hub, growth engine, and model of regional integration. Its diversity—from Singapore's wealth to Myanmar's poverty—makes it a laboratory for development strategies.
