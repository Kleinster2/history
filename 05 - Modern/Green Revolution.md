# Green Revolution

The Green Revolution transformed global agriculture, averting the Malthusian famine that many predicted in the mid-20th century. Through high-yield crop varieties, fertilizers, irrigation, and pesticides, agricultural productivity doubled or tripled across Asia and Latin America. India went from importing grain to self-sufficiency; Mexico became an exporter. The Green Revolution was institutional intervention at scale—states, foundations, and markets coordinating to solve a problem that markets alone couldn't. Its legacy includes abundance and criticism: environmental concerns, dependency on inputs, and uneven distribution of benefits.

## Overview

### Inputs

| Input | Importance |
|-------|------------|
| Nitrogen fertilizer | Most critical for yield gains |
| Haber-Bosch process | Industrial nitrogen fixation |
| Irrigation | Water control essential |
| Pesticides | Protect high-value crops |
| Credit | Farmers needed to buy inputs |

### Intensification

| Traditional | Green Revolution |
|-------------|------------------|
| One crop per year | 2-3 crops per year |
| Rain-fed | Irrigated |
| Few inputs | Package of inputs |
| Low yield | High yield |
| Low risk, low return | Higher risk, higher return |

## Results

### Production Gains

| Region | Wheat | Rice |
|--------|-------|------|
| India | +3.5x (1965-2000) | +2.5x |
| Philippines | n/a | +3x |
| Indonesia | n/a | +3x |
| China | +4x | +2.5x |
| Pakistan | +4x | +2x |

### Famine Averted

| Prediction | Reality |
|------------|---------|
| Paul Ehrlich (1968) | Predicted hundreds of millions would starve in 1970s-80s |
| Actual | Asian population doubled, hunger declined |
| Credit | Green Revolution technology + state policy |
| Borlaug | Nobel Peace Prize (1970) |

### Economic Effects

| Effect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Food prices | Declined in real terms |
| Labor | Some mechanization, but employment increased |
| Income | Farmers adopting HYVs prospered |
| Inequality | Early adopters benefited most |
| Urban | Cheap food enabled industrialization |

## The State's Role

### Why Not Just Markets?

| Problem | State Solution |
|---------|----------------|
| Research is public good | Public/philanthropic funding |
| Seeds need adaptation | National research programs |
| Credit constraints | Subsidized agricultural credit |
| Adoption risk | Extension services, demonstration |
| Price volatility | Minimum support prices |

### Policy Package (India Example)

| Policy | Effect |
|--------|--------|

## The Deeper Point

The Green Revolution demonstrates [[Institutions and Progress|institutional]] coordination solving a problem that markets alone couldn't. Private seed companies had little incentive to develop varieties for poor farmers in poor countries—no profitable market. Public and philanthropic funding (Rockefeller, Ford, CGIAR) created the technology; states (India, Philippines, Mexico) deployed it through subsidies, extension, and price supports. The [[Entrepreneurship|entrepreneurial]] energy was channeled by these institutions toward productivity rather than extraction. Critics argue the model created dependencies and environmental problems, but the counterfactual—hundreds of millions starving—is the relevant comparison. The political economy matters: large farmers in irrigated areas benefited most, and the subsidies that enabled adoption became fiscally unsustainable. India's food self-sufficiency came with groundwater depletion, input subsidies, and regional inequality. The Green Revolution's legacy is thus contested: undeniable success in averting famine, genuine concerns about sustainability and equity. The question for [[Development Economics]] is whether the next agricultural revolution—facing climate change, water scarcity, and nutritional deficits—can be achieved with new institutional forms that address both productivity and sustainability.
