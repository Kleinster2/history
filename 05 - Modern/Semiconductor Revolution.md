# Semiconductor Revolution

From vacuum tubes to integrated circuits. The semiconductor revolution created Silicon Valley and enabled the digital age. Between 1947 and 1971, a sequence of innovations—transistor, silicon transistor, planar process, integrated circuit, microprocessor—transformed electronics from bulky, expensive, unreliable vacuum tubes to tiny, cheap, reliable chips. This wasn't just technological progress; it was the birth of an industry, a region, and a new model of innovation.

## The Deeper Point

The semiconductor revolution wasn't just a technological breakthrough—it was an institutional innovation. The Fairchild founding created a new model: venture-backed startups where engineers owned equity and could leave to start competitors. This model—impossible under East Coast non-compete norms—became the [[Silicon Valley Model]]'s foundation.

The technical innovations mattered enormously: the transistor, planar process, and integrated circuit enabled everything that followed. But equally important was the *organizational* innovation. Shockley's dysfunction scattered talent that might have stayed at one company. Fairchild's New York ownership prevented founders from getting rich, so they left. California's non-compete ban meant they could take knowledge to competitors. Arthur Rock invented a financing model that provided capital without corporate control.

By 1971, when Intel shipped the 4004 microprocessor, all the elements were in place: the technology (integrated circuits), the geography (Silicon Valley), the financing (venture capital), the labor market (mobile engineers), and the culture (startups as normal). The [[PC Revolution]] and everything after built on this foundation.

The semiconductor revolution reveals the vault's central insight: [[Institutions and Progress|institutions channel ambition]]. The same brilliant engineers under East Coast corporate norms might have spent careers at Bell Labs or IBM. California's different institutional environment—legal (no non-competes), financial (venture capital), cultural (startup acceptance)—channeled that brilliance into [[Creative Destruction|creative destruction]] that remade the world.
