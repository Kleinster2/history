# Developmental State

The developmental state is the institutional form that enabled East Asia's economic miracle. Unlike both laissez-faire capitalism (which leaves development to markets) and socialist planning (which replaces markets), developmental states *guided* markets through selective intervention—directing credit, protecting infant industries, disciplining firms with export requirements, and investing massively in education. Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore all followed variations of this model, achieving the fastest sustained growth in history. The question is whether it can be replicated—or whether it was a product of specific Cold War conditions and Confucian cultures that no longer apply.

## Overview

### What Is a Developmental State?

| Feature | Character |
|---------|-----------|
| Economic goal | Industrialization, catch-up |
| State role | Guide, not replace, markets |
| Bureaucracy | Meritocratic, competent, insulated |
| Business relation | Embedded autonomy |
| Policy tools | Credit allocation, protection, discipline |
| Politics | Often authoritarian during development |

### The Successful Cases

| Country | Period | Growth Rate |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| Japan | 1950-1990 | ~8% annual |
| South Korea | 1960-1997 | ~8% annual |
| Taiwan | 1960-1990 | ~9% annual |
| Singapore | 1965-1990 | ~8% annual |
| China | 1980-present | ~9% annual |

## Core Concepts

### Embedded Autonomy (Peter Evans)

| Dimension | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| Autonomy | Bureaucrats insulated from political pressure |
| Embeddedness | Connected to business, understand industry |
| Balance | Neither captured nor isolated |
| Result | Can make tough decisions, with information |

### Bureaucratic Quality

| Feature | Japan (MITI) | Korea (EPB) |
|---------|--------------|-------------|
| Recruitment | Top university graduates |
| Prestige | Elite career |
| Insulation | From politicians |
| Rotation | Across industries |
| Information | Close firm contact |

### Industrial Policy Tools

| Tool | How It Works |
|------|--------------|
| Credit allocation | Directed lending to priority sectors |
| Import protection | Infant industry support |
| Export requirements | Discipline—must compete globally |
| Technology policy | Licensing, R&D support |
| Infrastructure | Targeted investment |
| Education | Technical training, universities |

## The Japanese Model

### MITI and Industrial Policy

| Period | Focus |
|--------|-------|
| 1950s | Reconstruction, basic industries |
| 1960s | Heavy and chemical industries |
| 1970s | Knowledge-intensive industries |
| 1980s | High-tech, services |

### Key Mechanisms

| Mechanism | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Administrative guidance | Informal pressure on firms |
| Preferential credit | Japan Development Bank |
| Tax incentives | Accelerated depreciation |
| Import control | Foreign exchange allocation |
| Technology licensing | MITI brokered deals |
| Cartels | "Recession cartels" to manage decline |

### Keiretsu System

| Feature | Function |
|---------|----------|
| Horizontal | Bank-centered groups (Mitsubishi, Mitsui) |
| Vertical | Supplier networks (Toyota system) |
| Cross-shareholding | Stability, long-term orientation |
| Main bank | Monitoring, rescue |
| See | [[Japanese Economic Miracle]] |

## The Korean Model

### State-Chaebol Relations

| Period | Character |
|--------|-----------|
| Park Chung-hee (1961-79) | State directs, chaebol executes |
| Chun Doo-hwan (1980-87) | Continued, some liberalization |
| Democratization (1987+) | Chaebol power increases |
| 1997 crisis | Restructuring imposed |

### How Korea Worked

| Tool | Implementation |
|------|----------------|
| Five-year plans | Targets for industries |
| Credit rationing | Banks state-controlled |
| Export targets | Monthly meetings, discipline |
| Heavy industries | POSCO, Hyundai Shipbuilding |
| Chaebols | Family conglomerates as vehicles |
| See | [[Korean Chaebol]] |

### Discipline Mechanisms

| Mechanism | How It Worked |
|-----------|---------------|
| Export requirements | No exports = no credit |
| Performance monitoring | Monthly export meetings |
| Firm failure allowed | Some groups disbanded |
| Reciprocal control | State gave, state took away |

## Taiwan and Singapore

### Taiwan Model

| Feature | Character |
|---------|-----------|
| SME focus | Less concentrated than Korea |
| State enterprises | Upstream industries |
| Flexible networks | Subcontracting webs |
| Technology parks | Hsinchu Science Park |
| KMT role | State-party guidance |

### Singapore Model

| Feature | Character |
|---------|-----------|
| FDI-led | Welcomed multinationals |
| State investment | Sovereign wealth (GIC, Temasek) |
| Strategic sectors | Petrochemicals, electronics, finance |
| Skills focus | Technical education |
| PAP dominance | One-party competent governance |

## Why It Worked: Prerequisites

### Political Conditions

| Factor | Importance |
|--------|------------|
| Authoritarian stability | Long time horizons |
| Elite coherence | Agreement on development goal |
| External threat | Cold War pressure |
| US support | Aid, markets, tolerance |
| Absence of landed elite | No blocking coalition |

### Institutional Conditions

| Factor | Importance |
|--------|------------|
| Bureaucratic quality | Competent implementation |
| [[State Capacity]] | Could actually do things |
| Prior land reform | Rural equality, legitimacy |
| Education base | Literate population |
| Colonial infrastructure | Japan built in Korea, Taiwan |

### Economic Conditions

| Factor | Importance |
|--------|------------|
| Late development | Could borrow technology |
| Small economies | Needed exports |
| Resource-poor | No resource curse |
| Labor abundance | Cheap workers initially |

## When Developmental States Fail

### Latin American Attempts

| Country | Problem |
|---------|---------|
| Brazil | ISI without export discipline |
| Mexico | State enterprises inefficient |
| Argentina | Political instability |

### African Attempts

| Country | Problem |
|---------|---------|
| Tanzania | Ujamaa failed |
| Ghana (Nkrumah) | Overreach, no capacity |

| Climate | Green industrial policy |
| COVID | Supply chain resilience |
| China competition | Chips Act, friend-shoring |
| Debate | "New Washington Consensus" |

## The Deeper Point

The developmental state is the [[Institutions and Progress|institutional]] form that channeled [[Entrepreneurship|entrepreneurial]] ambition into industrial production in East Asia. It wasn't laissez-faire—states actively directed credit, protected industries, and picked winners. But it wasn't planning either—firms competed, exports disciplined, and failure was permitted. The key was [[State Capacity|state capacity]] combined with embedded autonomy: bureaucrats competent enough to make good decisions and insulated enough to make tough ones, but connected enough to business to understand what was possible. The [[Korean Chaebol]] didn't succeed because Park Chung-hee left them alone; they succeeded because he pushed them into industries they feared, punished those who failed exports, and provided credit to those who performed. [[Varieties of Capitalism]] misses this: developmental states weren't coordinated market economies like Germany—they were directive in ways that would be impossible in Europe. The model's tragedy is that success destroyed its conditions: democracy and chaebol power in Korea, bubble and stagnation in Japan. The lesson isn't "do what Korea did"—it's that development requires institutions that channel business toward production while retaining capacity to discipline and redirect. Where those institutions come from remains the hard question.
