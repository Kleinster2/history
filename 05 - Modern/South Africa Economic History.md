# South Africa Economic History

From minerals to apartheid to democracy. South Africa shows how extractive [[Institutions and Progress|institutions]]—even when reformed politically—leave economic structures that are hard to transform.

## The Mineral Revolution (1867-1910)

### Discoveries

| Discovery | Date | Location |
|-----------|------|----------|

| Policy | Economic Function |
|--------|-------------------|
| Bantustans | Reservoir of cheap labor |

### Economic Model

| Feature | Mechanism |
|---------|-----------|
| Cheap black labor | Wages suppressed |
| White consumption | High standards for minority |

| Capital-intensive | Despite abundant labor |

### Growth and Crisis

| Period | Pattern |
|--------|---------|
| 1960-74 | 5%+ growth, "golden age" |
| 1974-94 | Stagnation, sanctions, disinvestment |
| Sharpeville (1960) | Capital flight |
| Soweto (1976) | Renewed crisis |
| 1980s | Debt crisis, sanctions bite |

### Sanctions Effect

| Type | Impact |
|------|--------|
| Financial | Loan recalls, debt crisis |
| Trade | Limited direct effect |

| Technology | Arms embargo |
| Psychological | International isolation |

## Transition (1990-1999)

### Negotiated Settlement

| Element | Outcome |
|---------|---------|
| Property rights | Protected |
| White pensions | Guaranteed |
| Reserve Bank | Independent |
| Civil service | Initially retained |
| ANC | Accepted market economy |

### GEAR (1996)

| Policy | Direction |
|--------|-----------|
| Growth, Employment and Redistribution | Market-oriented |
| Fiscal discipline | Deficit reduction |
| Trade liberalization | Tariff cuts |
| Privatization | Partial |
| Inflation targeting | Conservative |

### What Changed/Didn't

| Changed | Didn't Change |
|---------|---------------|
| Political power | Economic ownership |
| Voting rights | Wealth distribution |
| Social spending | Unemployment |
| Access to services | Spatial segregation |

## Post-Apartheid Economy (2000-Present)

### Black Economic Empowerment (BEE)

| Element | Implementation |
|---------|----------------|
| Ownership targets | % black ownership required |
| Procurement | Government purchasing |
| Employment equity | Affirmative action |
| Skills development | Training mandates |

### BEE Critique

| Criticism | Evidence |
|----------|----------|
| Narrow beneficiaries | Connected individuals |
| Tenderpreneurship | Corruption, fronting |
| Limited transformation | Ownership concentrated |
| Business deterrent | Compliance costs |

### Growth Record

| Period | GDP Growth |
|--------|------------|
| 1994-2008 | 3-5% |
| 2009 | -1.5% (GFC) |
| 2010-2019 | 1-2% |
| 2020 | -7% (COVID) |
| 2021-23 | Recovery, then stagnation |

## The Eskom Crisis

### State-Owned Enterprise Failure

| Problem | Manifestation |
|---------|---------------|
| Underinvestment | 1998-2008, no new capacity |
| Corruption | Captured procurement |
| Maintenance | Deferred, breakdowns |
| Coal quality | Contracts to connected parties |
| Debt | R400+ billion |

### Load Shedding

| Impact | Scale |
|--------|-------|
| Economic cost | 2-4% of GDP annually |

| Effect | Institutions hollowed out |

## Persistent Inequality

### The Numbers

| Measure | South Africa |
|---------|--------------|
| Gini coefficient | 0.63 (world's highest) |
| Unemployment | 35%+ (broad) |
| Youth unemployment | 60%+ |
| Poverty | 55% below poverty line |

### Spatial Inequality

| Legacy | Persistence |
|--------|-------------|
| Townships | Still where most Africans live |
| Former homelands | Poorest areas |
| Suburbs | Still largely white/wealthy |
| Commuting | Hours to work |

### Race and Class

| Pattern | Evidence |

| Black middle class | Growing but small |
| Black working class | Struggling |
| Black underclass | Massive unemployment |

## Contemporary Challenges

### Deindustrialization

| Sector | Trend |

| Services | Growing but not enough jobs |
| Agriculture | Limited |

### Structural Unemployment

| Factor | Contribution |
|--------|--------------|
| Education quality | Poor, apartheid legacy |
| Skills mismatch | Demand for skills, supply unskilled |
| Minimum wages | May price out low-productivity workers |
| Spatial mismatch | Jobs not where people live |
| Growth | Too slow to absorb labor force |

### Emigration

| Pattern | Scale |
|---------|-------|
| Skilled emigration | Doctors, engineers, professionals |
| Brain drain | Significant |
| Destination | UK, Australia, Canada |
| Effect | Skills shortage |

## The Deeper Point

South Africa shows how extractive [[Institutions and Progress|institutions]]—even when reformed politically—leave economic structures that are hard to transform. Apartheid was abolished, democracy established, rights guaranteed—but the economy remained structured around:

- **Mining**: Still significant but declining
- **Cheap labor**: Now unemployment instead of low wages
- **Spatial segregation**: Townships far from jobs
- **Skills gap**: Bantu education's legacy
- **Ownership concentration**: White capital, narrow BEE beneficiaries

The post-apartheid state faced an impossible challenge: transform the economy without disrupting the growth needed to fund redistribution. The negotiated settlement protected property rights and existing wealth. The economy needed white skills and capital to function. The ANC chose stability over radical redistribution.

The result is a democracy with world's-highest inequality, massive unemployment, and declining state capacity. The Eskom crisis embodies the problem: the state-owned enterprise that powered apartheid-era industrialization was captured and hollowed out, now throttling whatever growth potential remains.

South Africa's lesson for [[Development Economics|development]] is sobering: political transformation is necessary but insufficient. The structures that extractive institutions create—spatial, educational, ownership patterns—persist beyond formal legal change. Transforming those structures requires sustained institutional capacity that South Africa has struggled to maintain.
