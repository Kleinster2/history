# Brown Brothers Harriman

Brown Brothers Harriman is the oldest and largest private bank in America—a survivor that outlasted every other 19th-century partnership by refusing to go public, refusing to grow beyond its capacity, and cultivating relationships with power rather than chasing scale. Founded in 1818 when Alexander Brown opened a linen business in Baltimore, the firm evolved through generations into an investment bank, and in 1931 merged with the Harriman family's banking interests to create the ultimate establishment firm. Its partners—Prescott Bush, Robert Lovett, Averell Harriman—moved between Wall Street and Washington with ease, embodying the Eastern elite's assumption that governing and banking were aspects of the same vocation.

## The Deeper Point

Brown Brothers Harriman embodies the [[Institutions and Progress|institutional]] arrangement whereby American capitalism and American government were managed by the same people. The partners didn't just finance enterprises—they served as ambassadors, cabinet secretaries, senators, and presidential candidates. This wasn't corruption in the usual sense; it was a system where governing and banking were understood as complementary aspects of elite stewardship.

The firm's survival—when every other 19th-century partnership sold, merged, or collapsed—reflects deliberate choices about scale and structure. By remaining private, BBH avoided the pressures that pushed Goldman Sachs toward prop trading and Lehman Brothers toward excessive leverage. Partners' own capital at risk created different incentives than shareholders' money under quarterly earnings pressure.

The political critique is real: an unelected elite moved between private wealth management and public policy without clear boundaries. The Harriman-Bush network shaped Cold War policy, Vietnam negotiations, and presidential politics across decades. Whether this represented informed judgment by experienced people or undemocratic concentration of power depends on perspective—but the fact that it happened is not disputed.

BBH's persistence into the 21st century suggests there's a niche for boring, private, relationship-based banking that public markets can't fill. Some clients want discretion more than returns, stability more than growth, and a partner who'll still be there in fifty years. For that market, the oldest partnership on Wall Street remains competitive precisely because it refuses to change.
