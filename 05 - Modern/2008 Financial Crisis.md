# 2008 Financial Crisis

The 2008 financial crisis was the worst economic disaster since the Great Depression. A housing bubble inflated by easy credit and complex financial instruments collapsed, taking down major banks and freezing global credit. Governments bailed out the financial system at taxpayer expense, but the aftermath—slow recovery, austerity, and bailout resentment—reshaped politics for a generation.

## Political Consequences

## Lessons

### What We Learned

| Lesson | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Leverage kills | When it unwinds |
| Complexity dangerous | Can't be managed |
| Markets not self-correcting | Sometimes |
| Interconnection | Contagion risk |
| Ideology blind | "This time different" |

### Did We Learn?

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| Banks safer? | Somewhat |
| Crisis impossible? | No |
| Fundamental change? | Limited |
| Memory fading? | Yes |

### Comparison to Great Depression

| 1929 | 2008 |
|------|------|
| Let banks fail | Bailed out |
| Tight money | Loose money |
| No stimulus | Massive stimulus |
| 25% unemployment | 10% unemployment |
| 10-year depression | 18-month recession |

Policy mattered. The response, however imperfect, prevented a second Depression. But the resentments it created—bailouts for banks, austerity for citizens—continue to shape politics.

## The Deeper Point

2008 proved Minsky's thesis: stability breeds instability. The very success of post-Depression regulation—no major financial crisis for 60 years—created the political confidence to dismantle it. Deregulation didn't fail despite working; it failed *because* it initially worked, breeding the complacency that permitted ever-greater leverage. When the crisis came, policymakers correctly applied the Depression's economic lessons (lend freely, stimulate, don't let banks fail) but not its political lessons (restructure the system, hold actors accountable, reform fundamentally). The result: economic recovery without institutional legitimacy. Banks were saved but not reformed; executives were bailed out but not prosecuted; the system was stabilized but not changed. This gap between economic rescue and political justice produced the populist backlash (Tea Party, Occupy, Trump, Brexit) that still shapes politics—proving that [[Institutions and Progress|institutional]] frameworks require not just technical effectiveness but perceived fairness to maintain the social consent on which [[Property Rights|property rights]] themselves ultimately rest.
