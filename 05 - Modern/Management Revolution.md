# Management Revolution

Management—the coordination of other people's work—became the 20th century's most important profession. Scientific management promised to make factories efficient; human relations promised to make workers happy; strategy consulting promised to make firms competitive. The MBA became a global credential, consulting a $300 billion industry. Management is the invisible technology that makes complex organizations function.

---

## Human Relations (1930-1960)

### Hawthorne Studies (1924-1932)

| Finding | Implication |
|---------|-------------|
| Attention matters | Workers respond to being noticed |
| Social groups | Informal organization matters |
| Motivation | Not just money |
| Management style | Affects productivity |

## Strategy Era (1960-1990)

### Corporate Strategy

| Development | Creator |
|-------------|---------|
| SWOT analysis | Harvard (1960s) |
| BCG Matrix | Boston Consulting Group (1970) |
| Five Forces | Michael Porter (1979) |
| Value Chain | Michael Porter (1985) |
| Core Competence | Prahalad & Hamel (1990) |

### Porter's Framework

| Force | Question |
|-------|----------|
| Rivalry | How intense is competition? |
| New entrants | Who might enter? |
| Substitutes | What else serves the need? |
| Buyer power | Can customers squeeze you? |
| Supplier power | Can suppliers squeeze you? |

### The Consulting Industry

| Firm | Founded | Character |
|------|---------|-----------|
| McKinsey | 1926 | Strategy, prestige |
| BCG | 1963 | Analytical frameworks |
| Bain | 1973 | Results-focused |
| Big Four | Various | Audit + advisory |
| Revenue (2023) | $300+ billion | Industry scale |

### McKinsey's Innovation

McKinsey (1926) didn't just advise firms—it invented the idea that management itself is a transferable, purchasable expertise:

| Innovation | Significance |
|------------|--------------|
| "Top management" focus | Advised CEOs, not engineers |
| Generalist model | Same methods across industries |
| Up-or-out | Created alumni network in corporate leadership |
| Legitimacy | Made restructuring/layoffs "objective" |
| Talent pipeline | McKinsey alumni became Fortune 500 CEOs |
| Spread | Model copied globally—BCG, Bain, 1000+ firms |

The deeper innovation: McKinsey made management *separable from the firm*—a portable technology that consultants could carry between industries. This reinforced the idea that professional managers, not industry-specific expertise, drive business success. See [[Foundational Firms]].
