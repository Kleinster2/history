# PC Revolution

From hobbyist kits to ubiquitous tool. The personal computer revolution (1975-1995) put computing power on every desk, created the software industry, established the Wintel duopoly, and shifted power from hardware to software. What began with hobbyists soldering kits in garages became a $200 billion industry that transformed how humanity works, plays, and communicates.

## The Prehistory (1971-1976)

### Microprocessor Enables PC

| Date | Development |
|------|-------------|

## The Deeper Point

The PC revolution illustrates how platform economics create winner-take-all outcomes—and how the winners aren't always the obvious ones. IBM legitimized the market but captured little value because it chose openness over control. Apple created the best product but lost because closed systems can't match open ecosystem network effects. Microsoft and Intel won by controlling the bottlenecks: the one piece everyone needed.

The institutional insight connects to [[American Business Strategy]]: IBM's open architecture decision reflected old-economy assumptions (hardware matters, software is secondary). Microsoft understood that in a network-effects world, controlling the standard matters more than controlling the product. Gates's insistence on retaining DOS licensing rights—not IBM exclusivity—was the pivotal business decision of the PC era.

The PC revolution also created the [[Silicon Valley Model]]'s first mass-market success story. Apple's IPO (1980) showed that startups could create enormous value. Microsoft (Albuquerque, then Seattle) and Intel (Santa Clara) proved that platform companies could capture most of an industry's profits. The software industry that emerged—packaged products, retail distribution, upgrade cycles—established patterns that persisted until the internet disrupted them.

By 1995, the PC revolution was complete: 250 million computers worldwide, Microsoft and Intel dominant, and the stage set for the [[Dot-Com Bubble 2000|internet revolution]] that would transform the industry again.
