# Progressive Era

The Progressive Era was America's response to the Gilded Age's excesses. Between 1890 and 1920, reformers attacked monopoly power, regulated working conditions, and expanded democratic participation. Progressivism wasn't anti-capitalist—it aimed to save capitalism from itself by curbing its worst abuses and making the economy work for more than just the wealthy few.
