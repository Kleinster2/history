# Bretton Woods

The postwar international monetary architecture. At a 1944 conference in New Hampshire, 44 nations designed a system of fixed exchange rates, dollar-gold convertibility, and new international institutions—creating the framework for the postwar economic golden age and establishing American financial hegemony.

## The Conference

| Feature | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| Date | July 1-22, 1944 |
| Location | Mount Washington Hotel, Bretton Woods, NH |
| Participants | 44 Allied nations |
| Key figures | John Maynard Keynes (UK), Harry Dexter White (US) |
| Outcome | IMF and World Bank created |

## The Problem Being Solved

### Interwar Chaos

| Problem | Consequence |
|---------|-------------|
| Gold standard collapse | 1931, competitive devaluations |
| Currency instability | Trade disruption |
| Beggar-thy-neighbor | Tariffs, quotas, blocs |
| Great Depression | System failure |

### Goals

| Objective | Method |
|-----------|--------|
| Stable exchange rates | Fixed but adjustable |
| Free trade | Reduce barriers |
| Full employment | National policy space |
| Avoid 1930s | Cooperation, institutions |

## The System

### Exchange Rate Mechanism

| Feature | Design |
|---------|--------|
| Dollar-gold link | $35 per ounce |
| Other currencies | Fixed to dollar |
| Adjustment | ±1% band, then devalue with IMF |
| Capital controls | Permitted, even encouraged |

### Institutional Architecture

| Institution | Function |
|-------------|----------|
| IMF | Short-term balance of payments lending |
| World Bank (IBRD) | Long-term development lending |
| GATT (later) | Trade liberalization |

### US Role

| Feature | Significance |
|---------|--------------|
| Dollar as reserve | World holds dollars |
| Gold backing | US gold stock guarantees |
| Hegemonic stability | US underwrites system |
| Seigniorage | US benefits from reserve status |

## The Golden Age

### Performance

| Period | Character |
|--------|-----------|
| 1945-1971 | System operational |
| Growth | Unprecedented global growth |
| Trade | Expansion, liberalization |
| Stability | Few financial crises |

### Why It Worked

| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| US dominance | Clear hegemon |
| Capital controls | Limited speculative flows |
| Growth | All boats rising |
| Cooperation | Shared Cold War interests |

## The Tensions

### Triffin Dilemma

| Problem | Mechanism |
|---------|-----------|
| Liquidity need | World needs dollars |
| Dollar supply | US runs deficits |
| Confidence | More dollars, less gold backing |
| Contradiction | Can't have both liquidity and confidence |

### Structural Issues

| Problem | Development |
|---------|-------------|
| Asymmetry | US privilege, others adjust |
| Rigidity | Fixed rates hard to change |
| Speculation | One-way bets on devaluation |
| US deficits | Vietnam, Great Society spending |

## The Collapse

### Timeline

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| 1960s | Dollar overhang grows |
| 1968 | Two-tier gold market |
| August 1971 | Nixon closes gold window |
| 1973 | Floating rates begin |
| End | Bretton Woods system dead |

### Nixon Shock

| Action | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Gold window closed | No more $35/oz |
| Import surcharge | 10% tariff |
| Wage-price controls | Domestic inflation |
| Unilateral | No consultation |

## What Replaced It

### Floating Rates

| Feature | Character |
|---------|-----------|
| Market-determined | Supply and demand |
| Volatile | Significant fluctuations |
| Adjustment | Automatic, continuous |
| Policy autonomy | Monetary independence |

### Modified Institutions

| Institution | Evolution |
|-------------|-----------|
| IMF | Crisis lending, surveillance |
| World Bank | Development focus |
| Dollar | Still dominant reserve |

## Legacy

### What Survived

| Element | Status |
|---------|--------|
| IMF | Transformed but alive |
| World Bank | Major development actor |
| Dollar dominance | Continues |
| Trade liberalization | GATT → WTO |

### What Changed

| Element | Status |
|---------|--------|
| Fixed rates | Gone (except euro) |
| Capital controls | Largely removed |
| US hegemony | Relative decline |
| Financial crises | Returned with frequency |

## Lessons

### What Worked

| Feature | Why |
|---------|-----|
| Rules-based system | Predictability |
| Adjustment mechanism | Escape valve |
| Hegemonic leadership | Someone underwrites |
| Capital controls | Limit speculation |

### What Didn't

| Feature | Why |
|---------|-----|
| Gold anchor | Liquidity-confidence tradeoff |
| Fixed rates | Too rigid for shocks |
| Asymmetry | US exorbitant privilege |
| Inflexibility | Couldn't adapt |

## The Deeper Point

Bretton Woods shows that international monetary order requires [[Institutions and Progress|institutional architecture]]—and that architecture has distributional consequences. The system didn't emerge naturally from markets; it was designed by states pursuing national interests. The US got reserve currency status and the ability to run deficits; other countries got stability and trade access.

The system's success during the golden age demonstrated that coordinated international arrangements can enable growth and stability. Fixed exchange rates, capital controls, and institutional cooperation created conditions for unprecedented prosperity.

But the collapse revealed the system's contradictions. The Triffin dilemma was built in from the start. US domestic priorities eventually conflicted with international monetary responsibilities. When forced to choose, Nixon chose domestic politics.

The post-Bretton Woods era—floating rates, free capital flows, recurring crises—suggests the pendulum may have swung too far toward markets. The 2008 crisis renewed interest in whether international monetary cooperation might stabilize the system. But reproducing Bretton Woods conditions—clear hegemon, shared interests, capital controls—seems unlikely in a multipolar world.
