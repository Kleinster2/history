# Telegraph Revolution

The Victorian internet. The telegraph achieved what had been impossible since the beginning of history: instantaneous communication over distance. Markets, empires, journalism, and warfare were transformed when information could move faster than anything physical.

## The Breakthrough

### Invention

|-----------|------|--------|
| Cooke and Wheatstone | 1837 | British patent, needle telegraph |
| Samuel Morse | 1838 | Code system, single wire |

| First message | "What hath God wrought?" |

### How It Worked

| Component | Function |
|-----------|----------|
| Wire | Electrical conductor |
| Key | Operator sends pulses |
| Battery | Power source |
| Sounder/Printer | Receives signals |
| Code | Morse dots and dashes |

### Initial Skepticism

| Doubt | Reality |
|-------|---------|
| "Toy" | Initial dismissal |
| Railway use | First adopter |

### Europe

| Pattern | Character |
|---------|-----------|

## Transatlantic Cable

### The Challenge

| Obstacle | Difficulty |
|----------|------------|
| 2,000 miles | Of ocean |

| Insulation | Cable technology |
| Cost | Millions of pounds |

### Attempts

| Year | Result |
|------|--------|
| 1857 | Failed |
| 1858 | Brief success (3 weeks) |
| 1865 | Cable lost |
| 1866 | Permanent success |

### Impact

| Change | Consequence |
|--------|-------------|
| London-New York | Same-day communication |
| Financial markets | Integration |
| Business | Transatlantic coordination |
| Empire | Real-time control |

### Cable Network Expansion

| Route | Date |
|-------|------|
| Atlantic | 1866 |
| Mediterranean | 1868 |
| India | 1870 |
| Australia | 1872 |
| Global network | By 1900 |

## Economic Transformation

### Price Arbitrage Collapse

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| Prices differed across markets | Arbitrage instantaneous |
| Information traveled with goods | Information traveled instantly |
| Local markets | Connected markets |

### The Data

| Market | Pre-Telegraph Spread | Post-Telegraph |
|--------|---------------------|----------------|
| Cotton (NY-Liverpool) | Weeks lag | Hours |
| Wheat | Regional prices | National prices |
| Securities | Local trading | Coordinated |

### Reuters and News

| Development | Effect |
|-------------|--------|
| Reuters founded (1851) | News agency |
| Wire services | AP (1846), AFP |
| Business | Financial information |
| Model | Sell information, not transport |

### Banking and Finance

| Change | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| International transfers | Same day |
| Exchange rates | Unified |
| Credit | Verified faster |
| Securities | Arbitrage, integration |

## Railways and Telegraph

### Symbiotic Relationship

| Railway Gave | Telegraph Gave |
|--------------|----------------|
| Right of way | Train coordination |
| Poles | Safety signaling |
| Traffic | Revenue |
| Station access | Dispatch service |

### Traffic Management

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| Time-interval running | Signal block system |
| Frequent collisions | Safer operations |
| Inefficient use | Better scheduling |

## Imperial Communication

### The British Network

| Feature | Significance |
|---------|--------------|
| All Red Line | Global British network |
| Strategic | Imperial control |
| Redundancy | Multiple routes |
| Security | Wartime asset |

### Real-Time Empire

| Change | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Instructions | Hours not months |
| Crisis response | Immediate |
| Governor control | From London |
| Colonial administration | Centralized |

### The Indian Mutiny (1857)

| Before Telegraph | With Telegraph |
|------------------|----------------|

| Accuracy trade-off | Speed vs. verification |

## Market Structure

### Natural Monopoly Characteristics

| Feature | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| High fixed costs | Wire, stations |
| Low marginal costs | Additional messages cheap |
| Network effects | Value of connectivity |
| Result | Consolidation inevitable |

### Western Union

| Network infrastructure | Telephone, internet |
| Information business | Reuters, Bloomberg |
| Global connectivity | Everything after |
| Natural monopoly debates | Tech platforms |

## The Deeper Point

The telegraph was the first technology to separate communication from transportation. Before 1844, information could travel no faster than a horse, ship, or train. After, information traveled at the speed of light. This created discontinuity in economic history—[[Information Costs in History|information costs]] dropped to near zero for the first time.

The consequences were profound. Price arbitrage—buying cheap in one market and selling dear in another—had been the core of merchant profit for millennia. The telegraph collapsed price differentials within days of new connections. Markets that had been local became national, then global. The merchant as information arbitrageur largely disappeared.

The telegraph also demonstrated the economics of [[Infrastructure|network infrastructure]]: high fixed costs, low marginal costs, and network effects that made consolidation rational. Western Union's monopoly prefigured Standard Oil, AT&T, and today's tech platforms. The regulatory debates—natural monopoly vs. competition, private vs. public ownership—began here.

Institutionally, the telegraph showed that [[Institutions and Progress|infrastructure determines development]]. Regions connected early integrated into national and global markets. Regions left unconnected remained isolated. The choice of where to lay wire shaped economic geography—a pattern that continues with fiber optic and broadband today.
