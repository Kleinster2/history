# Asian Tigers

The Asian Tigers—South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, and Hong Kong—achieved the fastest sustained economic growth in human history. Between 1960 and 1997, they transformed from poor, war-torn, or colonial backwaters into wealthy, industrialized economies. Their success challenged both free-market orthodoxy and dependency theory, offering a third model: the developmental state.

| Taiwan | $163 | $13,235 | 81x |
| Singapore | $428 | $24,937 | 58x |

The Tigers showed that poor countries could become rich in a single generation. Their success inspired China and others—but whether their model can work elsewhere remains debated.
