# Trade Wars and Deglobalization

After 40 years of deepening trade integration, the 2010s-2020s brought reversal. The US-China trade war, Brexit, COVID supply chain disruptions, and geopolitical tensions are fragmenting the global economy. "Deglobalization" may be overstated—trade hasn't collapsed—but the direction has changed. The rules that governed trade since 1945 are being rewritten. Friend-shoring, reshoring, and strategic decoupling replace offshoring and integration. This is institutional restructuring at global scale—new rules channeling business toward security over efficiency.

## Overview

### The Shift

| Hyperglobalization (1990-2016) | New Era (2016-present) |
|-------------------------------|------------------------|
| Free trade expansion | Trade restrictions |
| Supply chain optimization | Supply chain resilience |
| China integration | China decoupling |
| Efficiency first | Security first |
| Multilateral rules | Bilateral deals |

### Key Events

| Year | Event |
|------|-------|
| 2016 | Brexit vote, Trump election |
| 2018 | US-China tariffs begin |
| 2020 | COVID exposes supply chain fragility |
| 2022 | Russia sanctions, chip export controls |
| 2023-24 | Friend-shoring, industrial policy revival |

## The US-China Trade War

### Origins

| Factor | Grievance |
|--------|-----------|
| Trade deficit | US-China $350B+ annual deficit |
| Job losses | Manufacturing employment down |
| IP theft | Forced technology transfer |
| Subsidies | State support for Chinese industries |
| Currency | Manipulation allegations |
| Security | Military-civil fusion concerns |

### The Tariffs

| Round | Scope |
|-------|-------|
| March 2018 | Steel (25%) and aluminum (10%) |
| July 2018 | $34B of Chinese goods (25%) |
| August 2018 | Additional $16B |
| September 2018 | $200B (10%, later 25%) |
| September 2019 | Nearly all Chinese imports covered |
| 2024 | Still in place under Biden |

### China's Response

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|

## COVID Supply Chain Crisis

### What Happened

| Phase | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| Early 2020 | China shutdowns—supply disruptions |
| Mid-2020 | Demand surge (goods over services) |
| 2021 | Port congestion, container shortage |
| 2022 | Inflation, chip shortage |
| 2023 | Gradual normalization |

### Revealed Vulnerabilities

| Issue | Example |
|-------|---------|
| Concentration | Taiwan makes 90%+ of advanced chips |
| Just-in-time fragility | No buffer stock |
| Single points of failure | Key component shortages |
| Geopolitical risk | China-Taiwan tensions |

### Policy Response

| Initiative | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| CHIPS Act (US) | $52B for domestic semiconductors |
| EU Chips Act | European chip production |
| Supply chain reviews | Critical sectors identified |
| Strategic stockpiles | Some inventory buildup |
| Friend-shoring | Reliable allied production |

## The Deeper Point

Trade wars and deglobalization represent [[Institutions and Progress|institutional]] restructuring at global scale. The post-1945 trading system—GATT/WTO, MFN, nondiscrimination—channeled [[Entrepreneurship|entrepreneurial]] energy toward efficiency through comparative advantage. The new system—tariffs, export controls, friend-shoring—channels it toward security and resilience. Both are legitimate goals; the trade-off between them is real. The hyperglobalization era delivered enormous gains (cheap goods, Asian development, poverty reduction) but also concentrated costs (manufacturing job losses, regional decline, strategic dependencies). The backlash was political (Brexit, Trump) and strategic (China's rise). Whether the new equilibrium involves managed integration or fragmented blocs depends on choices still being made. [[Globalization]] is not ending, but it's being reorganized around geopolitical lines. For [[Development Economics]], the implications are profound: the export-led industrialization that worked for Asian Tigers may not be replicable in a world of trade restrictions and supply chain controls. The rules of the game are changing—and with them, the channels through which national [[Developmental State|development strategies]] can succeed.
