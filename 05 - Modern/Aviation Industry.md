# Aviation Industry

Aviation shrank the world—but the industry itself rarely makes money. From the Wright brothers (1903) to global airline alliances, air travel transformed business, tourism, and geopolitics by collapsing distance. Yet airlines have destroyed more capital than they've created: high fixed costs, intense competition, fuel volatility, and labor power make profitability elusive. The industry's history is a case study in how transformative technologies can produce enormous social benefits while being terrible investments.

## Overview

## Airline Economics

### The Brutal Economics

| Factor | Problem |
|--------|---------|

| Labor | 30%+ of costs, often unionized |

### Revenue Management

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Yield management | Price discrimination by willingness to pay |
| Advance purchase | Lower fares for booking early |
| Restrictions | Minimum stay, change fees |
| Overbooking | Sell more seats than exist |
| Ancillary revenue | Baggage, seat selection, food |

### Why Airlines Don't Make Money

| Cycle | Pattern |
|-------|---------|
| Boom | Industry profitable |
| Expansion | Everyone orders planes |
| Overcapacity | Prices collapse |
| Bust | Bankruptcies, consolidation |
| Repeat | Every 5-10 years |
| Warren Buffett | "If a farsighted capitalist had been present at Kitty Hawk, he would have done his successors a huge favor by shooting Orville down." |

### COVID Impact

## The Deeper Point

Aviation is a case study in how [[Institutions and Progress|institutional]] and economic factors determine who captures value from transformative technologies. The airplane shrank the world, enabled globalization, created tourism, and made face-to-face business possible across continents. The social benefit is enormous. But airlines—the companies that operate the planes—have been value destroyers: high fixed costs, intense competition, and commodity-like service mean most profits are competed away. [[Entrepreneurship|Entrepreneurial]] talent in aviation flows to different niches: aircraft manufacturing (duopoly profits), airports (local monopolies), online travel agencies (booking platforms), or low-cost carriers (operational excellence). The deregulation experiment shows [[Business Regulation|institutional]] choices matter: regulated airlines were inefficient but stable; deregulated ones are efficient but chaotic. The industry's recurring bankruptcies, bailouts, and consolidation reflect a coordination failure: individually rational capacity expansion produces collectively irrational overcapacity. Aviation enabled [[Globalization]] while being one of its worst businesses. The value created went to consumers (cheap flights), airports (captive traffic), and manufacturers (duopoly rents)—not to the airlines themselves.
