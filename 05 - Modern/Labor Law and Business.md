# Labor Law and Business

Labor law determines how the gains from economic growth are distributed. When workers can organize, bargain collectively, and enforce minimum standards, more of the surplus flows to wages; when they cannot, more flows to capital. The [[Varieties of Capitalism|variety of capitalism]] a country develops depends fundamentally on its labor institutions—flexible American markets produce different firms than German codetermination or Japanese lifetime employment. Labor law isn't peripheral to business; it shapes everything from corporate strategy to national competitive advantage.

## Overview

### The Core Questions

| Question | Trade-off |
|----------|-----------|
| Can workers organize? | Collective power vs. employer discretion |
| At-will or protected? | Flexibility vs. security |
| Who shares the gains? | Capital vs. labor distribution |
| Training investment | Who pays, who benefits? |

### Labor Law Timeline

| Era | Character |
|-----|-----------|
| Pre-industrial | Master-servant, [[Guild Economics\|guilds]] |
| Early industrial | Factory Acts, first limits |
| Late 19th c. | Unions emerge, often suppressed |
| Progressive Era | First federal laws |
| New Deal | NLRA, labor's peak |
| 1970s-2000s | Decline in union density |
| 2010s+ | Gig economy, new forms |

## The Deeper Point

Labor law determines whether the gains from economic growth flow to workers or to capital—and in doing so, shapes everything from corporate strategy to national competitive advantage. The [[Varieties of Capitalism|varieties of capitalism]] framework shows that different labor institutions produce different business systems: German codetermination and vocational training create firms that compete on quality and worker skill; American at-will employment and weak unions create firms that compete on flexibility and reallocation. Neither is inherently superior—each produces different strengths and weaknesses. But the choice has profound distributive consequences: countries with strong labor institutions have lower inequality, while those with weak institutions see more gains flowing to capital. From the [[Institutions and Progress|institutional]] perspective, labor law is Baumol's insight applied to distribution: does [[Entrepreneurship|entrepreneurial]] ambition get channeled into creating value that's shared with workers, or into extracting value from them? The decline of American unions since the 1970s coincides precisely with the decoupling of productivity from wages—suggesting that worker bargaining power, not just productivity, determines living standards. The gig economy battles of the 2020s are fundamentally about whether the labor institutions of the 20th century will extend to new forms of work, or whether a new class of workers will lack the protections their grandparents won. [[State Capacity|State capacity]] to enforce labor law is the hidden variable: minimum wage laws matter only if violations are detected and punished.
