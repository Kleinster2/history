# Securities Regulation

Securities regulation determines who can access capital and on what terms. Before the 1930s, stock markets were casinos where insiders profited at the public's expense. The New Deal created a disclosure regime—the idea that if investors get accurate information, markets can discipline themselves. This institutional innovation enabled the modern capital market: millions of strangers investing in companies they've never visited, trusting that the numbers are real. Without securities regulation, there are no [[Stock Markets|stock markets]], no pooled capital for strangers, no modern corporation.

## The Deeper Point

Securities regulation is the institutional solution to a fundamental problem: how can strangers pool capital for enterprises they cannot monitor? The answer—mandatory disclosure, enforced by an independent agency, backed by private litigation—enabled the modern capital market where millions of investors fund companies they'll never visit, trusting that the numbers in filings are real. This is an institutional achievement comparable to [[Property Rights|property rights]] or [[Money|money]]: an abstract system of trust that enables cooperation among strangers at massive scale. The [[Business Firm|modern corporation]]—with dispersed shareholders, professional managers, and liquid stock—is only possible because securities law solved the information asymmetry that would otherwise make public investment a suckers' game. The recurring scandals (Enron, 2008, crypto) demonstrate that the regulatory system is never complete: [[Entrepreneurship|entrepreneurial]] talent flows toward regulatory arbitrage when the rules leave gaps. But the scandals also demonstrate the system's resilience—each crisis produces institutional learning (Sarbanes-Oxley, Dodd-Frank) that plugs the gaps. The deeper lesson: markets are not natural; they are institutionally constructed. The most liquid, deepest capital markets in the world exist in jurisdictions with the strongest securities regulation. [[State Capacity|State capacity]] to enforce disclosure rules is the hidden variable explaining why some stock markets are trusted and others are not.
