# Overseas Chinese Networks

The overseas Chinese—50 million people scattered across Southeast Asia and beyond—built one of history's most successful business networks without a state, without a legal system, and often without local political rights. Through family ties, dialect-group trust, and relentless commercial ambition, they came to dominate the economies of Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Singapore despite being ethnic minorities. The "bamboo network" demonstrates that business can flourish on trust and kinship alone—but also that minority commercial success without political power is precarious, inviting periodic backlash and violence.

## Overview

### Scale of Dominance

| Country | Chinese % of Population | Chinese % of Corporate Wealth |
|---------|------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Indonesia | 3% | 70% |
| Thailand | 14% | 80% |
| Malaysia | 23% | 60% |
| Philippines | 2% | 50-60% |
| Singapore | 75% | Majority (ethnic majority here) |

### The Puzzle

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| Why so successful? | Networks, trust, work ethic, capital pooling |
| Why minorities dominate? | Commerce as only channel for ambition |
| Why tolerated? | Economic utility (usually) |
| Why attacked? | Scapegoating, resentment, political utility |
| Parallel? | Jews in Europe, Armenians in Ottoman Empire |
