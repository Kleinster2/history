# Reconstruction

Reconstruction was America's first attempt to build a biracial democracy after slavery. Economically, it posed a fundamental question: how would the South's labor system be reorganized after emancipation? The answer—sharecropping without land redistribution—created a system of debt peonage that kept Black Southerners poor and dependent for generations.

## Overview

### The Central Question

| What Happened | What Didn't |
|---------------|-------------|
| Slavery abolished | Land redistributed |
| Citizenship granted | Economic independence |
| Voting rights (briefly) | Sustained federal protection |
| Legal equality (on paper) | Economic equality |

### Timeline

| Period | Phase |
|--------|-------|
| 1865-1866 | Presidential Reconstruction (lenient) |
| 1867-1877 | Congressional Reconstruction (radical) |
| 1877 | Compromise, federal troops withdrawn |
| Post-1877 | "Redemption" by white Southerners |

## Economic Devastation of the South

### The Destruction

| Measure | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| Confederate currency | Worthless |
| Confederate bonds | Worthless |
| Slave property | $3 billion eliminated |
| Infrastructure | Railroads, bridges destroyed |
| Agriculture | Fields untended, livestock killed |

### Comparative Wealth

| Year | Southern Per Capita Income (% of North) |
|------|----------------------------------------|
| 1860 | 72% |
| 1880 | 51% |
| 1900 | 51% |

### Capital Shortage

| Problem | Consequence |
|---------|-------------|
| Banks destroyed | No credit available |
| Planters broke | Couldn't pay wages |
| No outside investment | Slow recovery |
| Debt spiral | Everyone owed someone |

---

## The Land Question

### "40 Acres and a Mule"

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Sherman's Order (Jan 1865) | Set aside Sea Islands for freedpeople |
| Scale | 400,000 acres, 40,000 families settled |
| Promise | Economic independence through land |
| Reversal | Andrew Johnson returned land to planters |

### Why Land Redistribution Failed

| Factor | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| Property rights | Sanctity of property paramount |
| Johnson's policy | Restored planter land |
| Political will | Radical Republicans alone supported it |
| Precedent fear | What about Northern property? |

### What Land Would Have Meant

| With Land | Without Land |
|-----------|--------------|
| Independent farming | Dependent labor |
| Capital accumulation | Poverty trap |
| Political independence | Economic coercion |
| Generational wealth | Generational poverty |

---

## The Labor Question

### Competing Visions

| Group | Desired System |
|-------|----------------|
| Freedpeople | Independent farming, land ownership |
| Planters | Gang labor, coerced workforce |
| Northern Republicans | Free labor market, wages |

### Failed Alternatives

| System | Problem |
|--------|---------|
| Wage labor | Planters had no cash |
| Contract labor | Coercive, often violated |
| Government employment | Freedmen's Bureau underfunded |

---

## The Freedmen's Bureau

### Mission and Resources

| Feature | Reality |
|---------|---------|
| Created | March 1865 |
| Purpose | Aid freedpeople, manage abandoned lands |
| Staff | Never more than 900 agents |
| Territory | Entire former Confederacy |
| Funding | Chronically inadequate |

### Economic Functions

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Labor contracts | Supervised negotiations |
| Courts | Adjudicated disputes |
| Rations | Emergency food distribution |
| Education | Established schools |
| Land | Briefly distributed, then reversed |

### Limitations

| Constraint | Effect |
|------------|--------|
| Too few agents | Couldn't enforce contracts |
| Pro-planter bias | Many agents favored employers |
| No land policy | Couldn't provide independence |
| Short duration | Closed 1872 |

## Rise of Sharecropping

### How It Emerged

| Phase | Development |
|-------|-------------|
| 1865-1866 | Labor contracts, gang labor attempts |
| 1866-1868 | Freedpeople resist gang labor |
| 1868-1870s | Sharecropping becomes dominant |

### The Compromise

| Freedpeople Wanted | Planters Wanted | Sharecropping Provided |
|--------------------|-----------------|------------------------|
| Independence | Controlled labor | Partial autonomy |
| Family farming | Gang discipline | Family plots |
| Own land | Keep workforce | Tied to land |

### How It Worked

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Land | Planter provided plot |
| Labor | Sharecropper farmed it |
| Split | Typically 50/50 of crop |
| Supplies | Advanced on credit |
| Settlement | Annual, after harvest |

---

## The Crop Lien System

### Mechanism

| Step | Process |
|------|---------|
| 1 | Sharecropper needs supplies (seed, tools, food) |
| 2 | Merchant advances goods on credit |
| 3 | Crop is collateral (lien) |
| 4 | At harvest, merchant takes share first |
| 5 | If debt remains, rolls to next year |

### The Debt Trap

| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| High interest | 40-70% annual rates |
| Monopoly merchants | No competition |
| Crop price volatility | Bad year = deeper debt |
| Illiteracy | Couldn't verify accounts |
| Laws | Couldn't leave while in debt |

### Why Cotton?

| Factor | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| Merchant preference | Cash crop, marketable |
| Credit requirement | Only cotton accepted as collateral |
| Result | Monoculture persisted |
| Consequence | No diversification, exhausted soil |

## Black Economic Life

### Starting Point

| Resource | Amount |
|----------|--------|
| Land | Almost none |
| Capital | Zero |
| Education | 90%+ illiterate |
| Skills | Agricultural labor |

### Achievements Despite Obstacles

| Measure | Progress |
|---------|----------|
| Land ownership | ~20% of Black farmers by 1900 |
| Literacy | Rose to 50% by 1900 |
| Institutions | Churches, schools, mutual aid |
| Business | Small-scale entrepreneurship |

### Constraints

| Barrier | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| No capital | Couldn't buy land |
| Debt peonage | Couldn't leave |
| Violence | Economic success = target |
| Legal discrimination | Vagrancy laws, contract enforcement |

---

## White Planter Adaptation

### Loss and Recovery

| What Planters Lost | What They Kept |
|--------------------|----------------|
| Slave property | Land |
| Absolute labor control | Political power |
| Confederate investments | Social position |

### New Strategies

| Strategy | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Sharecropping | Retained labor without wages |
| Crop lien | Merchants replaced banks |
| Political power | Regained after 1877 |
| Violence | Enforced economic subordination |

---

## Redemption and Its Economic Meaning

### The Compromise of 1877

| Term | Effect |
|------|--------|
| Hayes becomes president | Republicans abandon South |
| Federal troops withdrawn | No enforcement of rights |
| Southern "home rule" | Democrats control |

### Economic Consequences

| Before 1877 | After 1877 |
|-------------|------------|
| Some federal protection | None |
| Black voting | Suppressed |
| Labor mobility | Restricted |
| Alternatives | Foreclosed |

---

## Why the Economic Revolution Failed

### Political Factors

| Factor | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| Limited radicalism | Even Radicals hesitated on land |
| Northern priorities | Reunion over justice |
| Racism | North shared much of it |
| Fatigue | Waning will after 1870 |

### Economic Factors

| Factor | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| Property rights | Redistribution seen as dangerous |
| Capital shortage | South had no resources |
| Global cotton market | Pressured monoculture |
| Labor interests | Keep wages low |

### The Path Not Taken

| What If | Possible Outcome |
|---------|------------------|
| Land redistribution | Black yeoman class |
| Extended Bureau | Sustained protection |
| Investment | Southern development |
| Reality | Poverty and subordination |

---

## Legacy

### Economic Patterns

| Pattern | Duration |
|---------|----------|
| Southern poverty | Into mid-20th century |
| Black land poverty | Persisted |
| Sharecropping | Lasted until 1940s |
| Racial wealth gap | Still exists |

### The Long Shadow

| Reconstruction Failure | Modern Consequence |
|------------------------|-------------------|
| No land redistribution | No generational wealth |
| Debt peonage | Economic vulnerability |
| Segregation | Limited opportunities |
| Violence | Great Migration |
