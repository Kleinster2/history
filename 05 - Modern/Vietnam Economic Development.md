# Vietnam Economic Development

Vietnam's transformation from post-war devastation to manufacturing export powerhouse is one of the most remarkable development stories of the late 20th century. Reunified in 1975 after decades of war, Vietnam struggled under central planning until the Doi Moi reforms of 1986 unleashed market forces. Since then, Vietnam has followed a "tiger economy" trajectory: export-led growth, foreign investment, integration into global supply chains, and dramatic poverty reduction—all while maintaining one-party Communist rule. The Vietnam model offers lessons about gradual reform, geographic advantage, and the relationship between political and economic freedom.

## The Deeper Point

Vietnam demonstrates that [[Development Economics\|economic development]] can proceed without political liberalization—a challenging finding for those who expected economic reform to bring democratization. The Communist Party maintained control while enabling market forces, foreign investment, and export-led growth. The question is whether this model can continue as Vietnam moves from labor-intensive manufacturing to innovation-driven growth, which may require more open information flows and civil society. Vietnam's success also reflects fortunate timing: joining global supply chains just as China became expensive, building [[Human Capital]] sufficient for manufacturing but not yet demanding political voice, and maintaining stability while neighbors experienced crises. The [[Deglobalization]] moment presents both opportunity (supply chain diversification benefits Vietnam) and risk (protectionism could limit access). Vietnam's next decade will test whether the tiger economy model can deliver continued convergence or whether the middle-income trap awaits.
