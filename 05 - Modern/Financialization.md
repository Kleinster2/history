# Financialization

Financialization—the growing dominance of financial markets, motives, and institutions—transformed capitalism after 1980. Finance went from servant of the real economy to master. Banks became casinos, corporations became asset managers, households became speculators, and profits flowed increasingly to those who moved money rather than made things.

## Overview

### What Financialization Means

| Dimension | Change |
|-----------|--------|
| Size | Financial sector grows relative to economy |
| Profits | Finance captures larger share |
| Corporations | Financial activities dominate |
| Households | Debt and investment rise |
| Power | Wall Street over Main Street |

### The Numbers

| Measure | 1980 | 2007 | Change |
|---------|------|------|--------|
| US financial sector % GDP | 4% | 8% | 2x |
| Financial sector % corporate profits | 10% | 40% | 4x |
| Financial assets % GDP | 150% | 350% | 2.3x |
| Household debt % income | 60% | 130% | 2.2x |

Finance was supposed to be the handmaiden of industry. Instead, it became the master. Whether this represents innovation or extraction, progress or pathology, remains the central economic question of our time.

## The Deeper Point

Financialization is what happens when the rules of the game reward paper over production. When financial returns exceed industrial returns for decades—as they have since the 1980s—rational actors shift from making things to trading claims on things. This isn't a market failure; it's markets working exactly as designed, responding to incentives set by [[Neoliberalism|policy]] (deregulation, low capital gains taxes, shareholder primacy doctrine). Philippon's finding that the finance industry has become *less* efficient over time—taking a larger share of GDP while providing no better capital allocation—confirms that financialization is extraction, not [[Innovation Economics|innovation]]. The medieval [[Medieval Financial Innovation|bill of exchange]] channeled finance into enabling trade; the modern CDO-squared channeled finance into enabling itself. The distinction between productive finance (funding enterprise) and extractive finance (trading existing claims) maps directly onto Baumol's framework: [[Institutions and Progress|institutional]] rules determine which kind dominates. Financialization is an institutional choice disguised as a market outcome.
