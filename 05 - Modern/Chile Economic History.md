# Chile Economic History

The neoliberal experiment. Chile is the test case for market-oriented reform in developing countries—the results show growth is possible but [[Inequality|distribution problems]] remain.

## Commodity Cycles (1810-1970)

## The Chilean Model Assessed

### What Worked

| Achievement | Evidence |

| Inflation control | Single digits |
| Fiscal discipline | Copper fund, surpluses |
| Institutional stability | Democracy consolidated |

| Social services | Quality varies by income |
| Middle-class squeeze | High costs, low pensions |

### Compared to Neighbors

| Metric | Chile | Argentina | Brazil |
|--------|-------|-----------|--------|
| GDP per capita (2020) | $15,000 | $10,000 | $7,500 |
| Inflation | 3% | 50%+ | 4% |
| Poverty | 8% | 35% | 21% |
| Gini | 0.45 | 0.42 | 0.53 |

## The Deeper Point

Chile is the test case for market-oriented reform in developing countries. Under Pinochet, the most radical free-market experiment in the developing world was implemented by force. Under democracy, much of it was retained while social spending increased.

The results are genuinely mixed:
- **Success**: Growth, poverty reduction, stability, institutional quality
- **Failure**: Inequality, pension inadequacy, social services stratification

The [[Institutional Economics|institutional question]] is whether Chile's market institutions channel ambition productively. On growth, clearly yes—Chile went from middle-income to nearly high-income. On distribution, the answer is contested: some see functioning markets that need supplementation, others see structural extraction by elites.

The 2019 explosion revealed deep discontent despite headline success. The lesson may be that [[Institutions and Progress|growth-enabling institutions]] are necessary but insufficient—legitimacy requires that gains be broadly shared. Chile built institutions that enabled growth; it may have failed to build institutions that distribute gains fairly. Whether further reform can address this without undermining growth remains Chile's central question.
