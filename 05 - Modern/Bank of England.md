# Bank of England

The institution that made modern finance. Founded in 1694 to fund war with France, the Bank of England pioneered central banking, national debt management, and paper money—creating the financial infrastructure that gave Britain decisive advantages in the struggle for European hegemony and global empire.

## The Deeper Point

The Bank of England demonstrates how [[Institutions and Progress|institutional innovation]] can create decisive advantages. Britain's financial revolution—of which the Bank was centerpiece—enabled the country to punch above its weight in European power struggles. Cheaper borrowing meant more ships, more soldiers, more war capacity.

But the Bank worked because of deeper [[Fiscal State Emergence|institutional foundations]]. The Glorious Revolution had established Parliamentary supremacy and protection of property rights. Creditors knew that governments controlled by property-owners wouldn't default on debts owed to property-owners. This credible commitment—not financial technique alone—made British debt cheap.

The Bank also shows how financial innovation compounds. Early success built reputation, which lowered rates, which enabled more borrowing, which funded more success. By 1750, Britain could borrow at 3% while France paid 5-8%. That 2-5% difference, compounded over decades of warfare, proved decisive.

[[Central Banking|Central banking]] itself evolved through crisis. Each panic taught lessons about liquidity, contagion, and intervention. Bagehot's principles—lend freely, at penalty rates, against good collateral—emerged from accumulated experience. The institution learned, adapted, and became template for the world.
