# Globalization

Globalization—the intensifying interconnection of economies, societies, and cultures across the world—has occurred in waves throughout history. The current phase, accelerating since the 1980s, has created unprecedented trade flows, capital mobility, and communication links. Earlier globalizations include the age of exploration, the late 19th century trade boom, and the post-WWII Bretton Woods system. Each wave transformed economies and sparked debates about winners and losers.

## Overview

|---------|-------------|
| Definition | Global interconnection |
| Dimensions | Economic, cultural, political |
| Current phase | 1980s-present |

### The Deeper Point

Globalization is not new—[[Roman Economy|Rome]], [[Indian Ocean Trade|the Indian Ocean]], [[Trade Networks|the Silk Road]], and the [[Atlantic Slave Trade|Atlantic system]] were all earlier integrations. Rome is the revealing contrast: it achieved Mediterranean-wide free trade through *empire* (one sovereign, one currency, one law), but when the political center collapsed, the economic integration collapsed with it. What distinguishes the modern version is its *institutional infrastructure*: international organizations (WTO, IMF, World Bank), standardized commercial law, container shipping, and digital communications that make trade nearly frictionless. Yet Rodrik's "trilemma" reveals the fundamental tension: you can have globalization, democracy, and national sovereignty—but not all three simultaneously. Each wave of globalization has been followed by political backlash when its costs (job displacement, inequality, cultural disruption) overwhelm its benefits for enough people. The pattern is as old as the [[Guild Economics|guilds]]: integration creates losers who organize politically.
