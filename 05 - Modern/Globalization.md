# Globalization

Globalization—the intensifying interconnection of economies, societies, and cultures across the world—has occurred in waves throughout history. The current phase, accelerating since the 1980s, has created unprecedented trade flows, capital mobility, and communication links. Earlier globalizations include the age of exploration, the late 19th century trade boom, and the post-WWII Bretton Woods system. Each wave transformed economies and sparked debates about winners and losers.

## Historical Waves

### Ancient Integration (pre-1500)

| System | Character |
|--------|-----------|
| [[Bronze Age Collapse\|Late Bronze Age]] (1500-1200 BCE) | First systemic integration—interdependent supply chains (copper + tin = bronze); collapse cascaded across all participants |
| [[Roman Economy\|Pax Romana]] (27 BCE-476 CE) | Integration through empire—common currency, law, roads; collapsed with political center |
| [[Indian Ocean Trade]] (ancient-1500) | Integration through merchants—no single political authority; survived empires rising and falling |
| [[Trade Networks\|Silk Road]] | Loose networks, intermediaries, no central control |
| Lesson | Empire-based integration is efficient but fragile; merchant networks are resilient but thin; modern institutions attempt both depth and durability |

### Early Globalization (1500-1800)

| Feature | Character |
|---------|-----------|
| [[Columbian Exchange]] | Biological, economic |
| [[Silver Trade]] | Global money flows |
| European expansion | Colonial networks |
| Mercantilism | Trade philosophy |

### First Modern Globalization (1870-1914)

| Feature | Character |
|---------|-----------|
| Trade | Dramatic expansion |
| Capital | International investment |
| Migration | Mass movement |

| End | World War I |

### Interwar Retreat (1914-1945)

| Feature | Character |
|---------|-----------|
| World War I | Disruption |
| Protectionism | Tariff barriers |
| [[Great Depression]] | Collapse |
| Autarky | Self-sufficiency |
| World War II | Further disruption |

### Bretton Woods Era (1945-1973)

| Feature | Character |
|---------|-----------|
| Institutions | IMF, World Bank, GATT |
| Currency | Dollar standard |
| Trade | Liberalization |
| Growth | "Golden age" |
| End | Nixon shock 1971 |

### The Deeper Point

Globalization is not new—the [[Bronze Age Collapse|Late Bronze Age]] trading system (1500-1200 BCE) was the first: interdependent supply chains where bronze itself required copper from Cyprus and tin from Afghanistan, making the technology impossible without long-distance trade. Its collapse around 1200 BCE is the earliest "deglobalization"—and the most instructive, because it shows that integrated systems can fail *systemically*, each node's collapse cascading to the next. [[Roman Economy|Rome]] achieved integration through empire; the [[Indian Ocean Trade|Indian Ocean]] achieved it through merchants; the [[Atlantic Slave Trade|Atlantic system]] through coercion. What distinguishes the modern version is its *institutional infrastructure*: international organizations (WTO, IMF, World Bank), standardized commercial law, container shipping, and digital communications that make trade nearly frictionless. Yet Rodrik's "trilemma" reveals the fundamental tension: you can have globalization, democracy, and national sovereignty—but not all three simultaneously. Each wave of globalization has been followed by political backlash when its costs (job displacement, inequality, cultural disruption) overwhelm its benefits for enough people. The pattern is as old as the [[Guild Economics|guilds]]: integration creates losers who organize politically.
