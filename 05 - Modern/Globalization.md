# Globalization

Globalization—the intensifying interconnection of economies, societies, and cultures across the world—has occurred in waves throughout history. The current phase, accelerating since the 1980s, has created unprecedented trade flows, capital mobility, and communication links. Earlier globalizations include the age of exploration, the late 19th century trade boom, and the post-WWII Bretton Woods system. Each wave transformed economies and sparked debates about winners and losers.
