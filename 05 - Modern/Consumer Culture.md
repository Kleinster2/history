# Consumer Culture

Before the 20th century, businesses made things and waited for customers. Then advertising, branding, and marketing learned to *create* demand—to make people want things they didn't know they needed. This revolution in demand-creation is as important as any revolution in production. Consumer culture transformed capitalism from a system that supplied needs into one that manufactured desires. It shaped cities (malls, suburbs), media (ad-funded), politics (political marketing), and identity itself (you are what you buy).
