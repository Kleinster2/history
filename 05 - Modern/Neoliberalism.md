# Neoliberalism

Neoliberalism—the turn toward markets, deregulation, and globalization—reshaped the world economy after 1980. Born from the failures of the 1970s, championed by Reagan and Thatcher, and spread globally through the Washington Consensus, it delivered growth and efficiency but also inequality and instability. Whether salvation or catastrophe, it defined the economic order of the late 20th century.
