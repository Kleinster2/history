# Malaysian Economic History

From tin and rubber colony to manufacturing hub. Malaysia's development combined ethnic affirmative action (NEP) with export-oriented industrialization, creating a middle-income economy that defied the 1997 crisis through heterodox capital controls. The tension between Malay political dominance and Chinese economic strength shapes everything.

## The Deeper Point

Malaysia's development reveals the political economy of [[Institutions and Progress|institutional design]] in plural societies. The NEP was an explicit attempt to change who benefits from growth—forcing wealth redistribution through state intervention, quotas, and affirmative action. It worked: Malay poverty fell dramatically, and a Malay middle class emerged.

But the NEP also created rent-seeking opportunities. Quotas became licenses for cronies. State enterprises became patronage networks. The 1MDB scandal showed how these structures could be captured for extraction rather than development.

The 1997 crisis response illuminates another dimension. Malaysia's capital controls, heretical at the time, worked—or at least didn't fail. This suggests that the relationship between markets and institutions is more complex than Washington Consensus orthodoxy assumed. Sometimes heterodox responses work when institutions are strong enough to implement them.

Malaysia's current middle-income trap reflects these tensions. The institutions that enabled catch-up growth—ethnic redistribution, state enterprises, protected industries—may now constrain further development. The question is whether Malaysia can reform without destabilizing the ethnic bargain that has maintained peace since 1969.
