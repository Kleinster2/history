# Japanese Stagnation

Japan's "Lost Decades" began when the bubble burst in 1990 and continue in some form today. The world's second-largest economy stopped growing, prices fell, and neither fiscal stimulus nor monetary easing could restart the engine. Japan became a warning: what happens when a miracle ends, a population ages, and an economic model hits its limits.

## Overview

|---------|------|------|

| Real GDP growth (annual avg) | — | <1% |
| GDP per capita (rel. to US) | 85% | 65% |
| Government debt % GDP | 65% | 260% |

## Why Recovery Failed

### Balance Sheet Recession

| Problem | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Negative equity | Assets < liabilities |
| Debt overhang | Must pay down debt |
| No borrowing | Despite low rates |
| No investment | Firms repair balance sheets |

### Banking Crisis

| Issue | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| Bad loans | Hidden, massive |
| Zombie banks | Kept lending to zombies |
| Zombie firms | Kept alive, unproductive |
| Capital shortage | Banks couldn't lend |
| Denial | Delayed reckoning |

### Delayed Response

| Year | Action | Problem |
|------|--------|---------|
| 1992-1997 | Hesitant stimulus | Too small |
| 1997 | Fiscal tightening | Made it worse |
| 1997-98 | Banking crisis | Finally addressed |
| 1999 | Zero interest rates | Not enough |

---

## Deflation

### The Deflation Trap

| Year | CPI Change |
|------|------------|
| 1999 | -0.3% |
| 2000 | -0.7% |
| 2009 | -1.4% |
| Average (1999-2012) | ~0% |

### Why Deflation Hurts

| Effect | Mechanism |
|--------|-----------|
| Real debt rises | Owed amount fixed, income falls |
| Postponed consumption | Wait for lower prices |
| Lower investment | Why invest if prices fall? |
| Wage stagnation | Sticky wages, real wages unclear |

### Why Deflation Persisted

| Factor | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Expectations | People expected deflation |
| Output gap | Chronic excess capacity |
| Import prices | China competition |
| BOJ credibility | Couldn't convince markets |

| 2023 | 260% |

### Why No Crisis?

| Domestic holders | Japanese own Japanese debt |
| Low rates | Debt service affordable |
