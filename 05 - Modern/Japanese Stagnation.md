# Japanese Stagnation

Japan's "Lost Decades" began when the bubble burst in 1990 and continue in some form today. The world's second-largest economy stopped growing, prices fell, and neither fiscal stimulus nor monetary easing could restart the engine. Japan became a warning: what happens when a miracle ends, a population ages, and an economic model hits its limits.

## Overview

### The Stagnation

| Measure | 1990 | 2023 |
|---------|------|------|
| Nikkei 225 | 38,915 | ~33,000 |
| Real GDP growth (annual avg) | — | <1% |
| GDP per capita (rel. to US) | 85% | 65% |
| Government debt % GDP | 65% | 260% |

### Lost Decades Timeline

| Period | Character |
|--------|-----------|
| 1991-1997 | Denial, hesitant response |
| 1997-2002 | Financial crisis, deflation |
| 2002-2008 | Export-led recovery |
| 2008-2012 | Global crisis, earthquake |
| 2012-2020 | Abenomics experiment |
| 2020-present | COVID, reflation attempts |

## The Bubble's Burst

### The Bubble (1985-1990)

| Asset | Peak |
|-------|------|
| Nikkei 225 | 38,915 (Dec 1989) |
| Land prices | 5.5x 1980 levels |
| Imperial Palace | "Worth more than California" |
| Bank lending | Tripled |

### Causes of Bubble

| Factor | Mechanism |
|--------|-----------|
| Plaza Accord | Yen appreciation |

## Why Recovery Failed

### Balance Sheet Recession

| Problem | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Negative equity | Assets < liabilities |
| Debt overhang | Must pay down debt |
| No borrowing | Despite low rates |
| No investment | Firms repair balance sheets |

### Banking Crisis

| Issue | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| Bad loans | Hidden, massive |
| Zombie banks | Kept lending to zombies |
| Zombie firms | Kept alive, unproductive |
| Capital shortage | Banks couldn't lend |
| Denial | Delayed reckoning |

### Delayed Response

| Year | Action | Problem |
|------|--------|---------|
| 1992-1997 | Hesitant stimulus | Too small |
| 1997 | Fiscal tightening | Made it worse |
| 1997-98 | Banking crisis | Finally addressed |
| 1999 | Zero interest rates | Not enough |

---

## Deflation

### The Deflation Trap

| Year | CPI Change |
|------|------------|
| 1999 | -0.3% |
| 2000 | -0.7% |
| 2009 | -1.4% |
| Average (1999-2012) | ~0% |

### Why Deflation Hurts

| Effect | Mechanism |
|--------|-----------|
| Real debt rises | Owed amount fixed, income falls |
| Postponed consumption | Wait for lower prices |
| Lower investment | Why invest if prices fall? |
| Wage stagnation | Sticky wages, real wages unclear |

### Why Deflation Persisted

| Factor | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Expectations | People expected deflation |
| Output gap | Chronic excess capacity |
| Import prices | China competition |
| BOJ credibility | Couldn't convince markets |

---

## Fiscal Policy Experiments

### Massive Stimulus

| Decade | Stimulus Packages |
|--------|-------------------|
| 1990s | 10+ packages, trillions of yen |
| 2000s | Continued |
| 2010s | Abenomics |

### Results

| Achievement | Failure |
|-------------|---------|
| Prevented depression | Didn't restore growth |
| Built infrastructure | Diminishing returns |
| Supported employment | Debt exploded |

### The Debt Mountain

| Year | Debt % GDP |
|------|------------|
| 1990 | 65% |
| 2000 | 135% |
| 2010 | 215% |
| 2023 | 260% |

### Why No Crisis?

| Factor | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| Domestic holders | Japanese own Japanese debt |
| Low rates | Debt service affordable |
| Current account surplus | Still exporting capital |
| BOJ buying | Monetizing debt |

---

## Monetary Policy

### Zero Interest Rate Policy (ZIRP)

| Year | Introduction |
|------|--------------|
| 1999 | First in world |
| Effect | Rates at zero |
| Problem | Still not enough |

### Quantitative Easing (2001-2006, 2013-)

| Policy | Action |
|--------|--------|
| Asset purchases | BOJ buys bonds, ETFs |
| Balance sheet | Exploded |
| Goal | Raise inflation expectations |
| Result | Limited effect on growth |

### Negative Interest Rates (2016)

| Policy | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| -0.1% | Charged banks for reserves |
| Intention | Force lending |
| Result | Unintended consequences |

---

## Structural Problems

### Demographics

| Factor | Data |
|--------|------|
| Population peak | 2010 (128 million) |
| Population 2023 | 124 million (declining) |
| Over 65 | 30% |
| Working age | Shrinking |
| Fertility | 1.2 |

### Implications of Aging

| Effect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Labor force | Declining |
| Consumption | Less |
| Social security | Burden growing |
| Innovation | Possibly slower |

### Dual Labor Market

| Track | Characteristics |
|-------|-----------------|
| Regular workers | Lifetime employment, declining |
| Non-regular | 40% of workforce, precarious |
| Wages | Non-regular = 60% of regular |
| Mobility | Limited |

### Corporate Stagnation

| Issue | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Low investment | Cash hoarding |
| Risk aversion | No new ventures |
| Low returns | ROE <10% |
| Zombie firms | Still operating |

---

## Abenomics (2012-2020)

### The Three Arrows

| Arrow | Policy |
|-------|--------|
| First | Aggressive monetary easing |
| Second | Flexible fiscal policy |
| Third | Structural reform |

### Results

| Achievement | Failure |
|-------------|---------|
| Yen weakened | Didn't restore growth |
| Stocks rose | Wages didn't |
| Employment rose | Mostly non-regular |
| Inflation | Briefly reached 2% |

### Third Arrow Problems

| Reform | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Labor market | Minimal |
| Corporate governance | Some improvement |
| Agriculture | Limited |
| Immigration | Slightly opened |

## Comparisons and Lessons

### What Japan Teaches

| Lesson | Implication |
|--------|-------------|
| Balance sheet recessions | Different from normal |
| Deflation is hard to escape | Expectations matter |
| Demographics matter | Aging = slow growth |
| Debt can persist | But at a cost |
| Models age | What worked can stop working |

### For Other Countries

| Warning | Context |
|---------|---------|
| Post-2008 US | Avoided Japan's mistakes? |
| Europe | Has own problems |
| China | Eerie similarities |

---

## Japan Today

### Current Situation

| Feature | Status |
|---------|--------|
| Growth | Low but positive |
| Inflation | Returning (2022-) |
| Yen | Weakened significantly |
| Wages | Finally rising? |
| Debt | Enormous but stable |

### The Puzzle

| Question | Debate |
|----------|--------|
| Is Japan fine? | High living standards |
| Is Japan stuck? | No dynamism |
| Is Japan a warning? | For aging societies |
| Has Japan adapted? | To slow growth |

## The Deeper Point

Japan's Lost Decades are the mirror image of the [[Japanese Economic Miracle]]—and together they prove that [[Institutions and Progress|institutional]] fitness is context-dependent, not absolute. The same institutions that enabled miracle growth (patient capital, lifetime employment, guided competition, bank-centered finance) became the institutions of stagnation once Japan reached the technological frontier. Lifetime employment prevented [[Creative Destruction|creative destruction]] by making firm failure socially unacceptable; bank-centered finance kept zombie firms alive rather than reallocating capital; the bureaucracy that once guided catch-up investment now protected incumbents from disruption. Koo's "balance sheet recession" diagnosis is correct mechanically (firms deleveraging rather than investing), but the deeper question is why Japan couldn't restart [[Innovation Economics|innovation]]-driven growth the way the US did after its own financial crises. The answer is institutional: Japan optimized for incremental improvement within established industries, not for the entrepreneurial entry and exit that drives frontier innovation. The [[Demographic Transition|demographic]] dimension compounds everything—an aging, shrinking population reduces both demand and dynamism. Japan isn't a failure; it's a warning that institutional success creates institutional lock-in, and that the institutions of catch-up are not the institutions of frontier growth. Every developmental [[State Capacity|state]] faces this transition; most haven't solved it.
