# Nigeria Economic History

The [[Resource Curse|resource curse]] case study. Nigeria is the classic example—oil abundance destroyed the [[Institutions and Progress|institutions]] and incentives for diversified development.

## Structural Adjustment (1986-1999)

### The SAP

| Policy | Implementation |
|--------|----------------|
| Devaluation | Naira collapsed |
| Trade liberalization | Tariff reduction |
| Privatization | Limited |

| Insecurity | Spreading beyond Northeast |
| State capacity | Weak, declining |

## The Deeper Point

Nigeria is the classic [[Resource Curse|resource curse]]—oil abundance destroyed the [[Institutions and Progress|institutions]] and incentives for diversified development. Before oil, Nigeria had a diversified agricultural export economy with regional specialization. Oil revenues eliminated the need for agricultural development, made non-oil exports uncompetitive (Dutch disease), and created massive resources for patronage and corruption.

The institutional mechanism is clear: when governments can fund themselves from oil, they don't need to bargain with citizens for taxation. Without that bargain, accountability disappears. Oil revenues become prizes to capture rather than resources to invest. Every regime—military and civilian—has followed the same pattern: capture oil revenues, distribute to supporters, steal personally, neglect development.

The comparison with [[Botswana Economic History|Botswana]] is instructive: both discovered resources at independence, but Botswana built institutions first (pre-colonial cattle-based elite already had property rights culture). Nigeria's fractured colonial legacy—three regions, multiple ethnicities, no shared institutions—meant oil became a source of conflict rather than development.

Nigeria's challenge is now even harder: oil production is declining, the population is growing, and the institutional weakness that oil enabled now prevents recovery. The fintech sector in Lagos shows what Nigerian entrepreneurship can achieve—but scaling that against the headwinds of power shortages, corruption, and insecurity remains the unfulfilled promise.
