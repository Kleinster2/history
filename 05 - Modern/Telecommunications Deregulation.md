# Telecommunications Deregulation

How institutional choices shaped the digital revolution. The breakup of AT&T, privatization of British Telecom, and global liberalization wave transformed telecommunications from state-regulated monopolies to competitive markets. These choices determined who could innovate, who could enter, and how the internet would develop.

## The Regulated Era

### The Natural Monopoly Argument

| Claim | Logic |
|-------|-------|
| High fixed costs | Network infrastructure expensive |
| Low marginal costs | Additional calls cheap |
| Universal service | One provider can serve all |
| Duplication wasteful | Why build two networks? |
| Conclusion | Regulate the monopoly |

### The American System (1913-1984)

| Feature | Character |
|---------|-----------|
| AT&T monopoly | Bell System |
| Kingsbury Commitment (1913) | Regulated monopoly accepted |
| Universal service | Cross-subsidized |
| Research | Bell Labs |
| Manufacturing | Western Electric |

### Bell Labs Achievement

| Innovation | Date |
|------------|------|
| Transistor | 1947 |
| Information theory | 1948 |
| Laser principles | 1958 |
| UNIX | 1969 |
| Nobel Prizes | 9 |

### European PTTs

| Model | Character |
|-------|-----------|
| Post, Telegraph, Telephone | Combined state monopolies |
| Universal service | Political mandate |
| Cross-subsidy | Business subsidized residential |
| Employment | Guaranteed jobs |
| Innovation | Slower than US |

## The AT&T Breakup

### Background

| Pressure | Source |
|----------|--------|
| MCI lawsuit | Long-distance competition |
| Antitrust case | DOJ since 1974 |
| Technology change | Microwave, satellites |
| Business demand | Lower prices |

### The Consent Decree (1984)

| Change | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| AT&T keeps long-distance | Competitive |
| Seven Baby Bells | Local monopolies |
| Equipment manufacturing | Open competition |
| Bell Labs split | Some to Lucent |

### Results

| Outcome | Evidence |
|---------|----------|
| Long-distance prices | Fell dramatically |
| Competition | MCI, Sprint |
| Innovation | Accelerated |
| Baby Bells | Eventually reconsolidated |

### Long-Distance Price Decline

| Year | Cost per Minute (Interstate) |
|------|------------------------------|
| 1984 | $0.40+ |
| 1990 | $0.15 |
| 2000 | $0.05 |
| 2010 | Near zero (bundled) |

## British Telecom Privatization

### Mercury Challenge (1981)

| Innovation | First competitor |
|------------|-----------------|
| Mercury | Licensed 1981 |
| Duopoly | Limited competition |
| Cable | Later entrants |

### BT Privatization (1984)

| Feature | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| Largest IPO | At the time |
| Shares | Widely distributed |
| Oftel | New regulator |
| Model | Copied worldwide |

### Regulatory Framework

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Price caps | RPI-X formula |
| Interconnection | Access to BT network |
| Universal service | Obligation maintained |
| Competition | Gradually introduced |

### The RPI-X Innovation

| Mechanism | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| Price ceiling | Can rise at inflation minus X% |
| Efficiency incentive | Keep savings above X |
| Predictability | For business planning |
| Copied | Worldwide |

## Global Liberalization Wave

### WTO Basic Telecommunications Agreement (1997)

| Feature | Commitment |
|---------|------------|
| 69 countries | Liberalization pledges |
| Market access | Foreign entry allowed |
| Interconnection | Required |
| Independent regulators | Promised |

### Patterns

| Region | Approach |
|--------|----------|
| US | Antitrust breakup |
| UK | Privatization + competition |
| Europe | Gradual opening |
| Japan | NTT partial privatization |
| Developing | Often later, with mobile |

### Mobile Leapfrogging

| Phenomenon | Effect |
|------------|--------|
| Wireless | Cheaper than fixed |
| Developing countries | Skipped fixed line phase |
| Competition | Multiple carriers |
| Africa, Asia | Mobile-first markets |

## The Telecommunications Act of 1996

### Goals

| Objective | Method |
|-----------|--------|
| Competition | In all markets |
| Local entry | CLECs (competitive local carriers) |
| Convergence | Phone, cable, internet |
| Universal service | Updated mechanisms |

### Reality vs. Intent

| Intent | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| Local competition | Limited—Baby Bells defended |
| Cable-phone competition | Some |
| Internet | Unintended beneficiary |
| Consolidation | Eventually dominated |

## Internet Implications

### Common Carrier Legacy

| Principle | Effect on Internet |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Non-discrimination | Networks carry all content |
| Interconnection | Networks must connect |
| No content control | Can't block |
| Openness | Enabled innovation |

### Net Neutrality Debates

| Position | Argument |
|----------|----------|
| Neutrality | All bits equal, innovation at edges |
| Tiering | Network investment needs incentives |
| Regulation | Varies by jurisdiction, time |

### Who Built the Internet?

| Contribution | Source |
|--------------|--------|
| Basic research | DARPA (government) |
| Protocols | Academic, government |
| Commercialization | Private |
| Backbone | Telecom companies |
| Applications | Startups |

## Outcomes

### Prices

| Service | Trend |
|---------|-------|
| Long-distance | Collapsed to near-zero |
| International | Similar |
| Mobile | Declining per unit |
| Broadband | Varies, complex |

### Investment

| Metric | Direction |
|--------|-----------|
| Infrastructure | Initially increased |
| Fiber | Expanded |
| Mobile | Massive |
| Dot-com bubble | Overinvestment, crash |

### Consolidation

| Pattern | Examples |
|---------|----------|
| Baby Bells reconsolidated | AT&T (again), Verizon |
| Mobile | Four major carriers (US) |
| Cable | Comcast, Charter |
| Vertical integration | Content + distribution |

## Debates and Controversies

### Did Competition Work?

| Success | Failure |
|---------|---------|
| Long-distance | Competitive, cheap |
| Mobile | Competitive (mostly) |
| Broadband | Duopoly, expensive (US) |
| Rural | Underserved |

### Universal Service

| Tension | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| Competition | Cherry-picking profitable |
| Rural areas | Cross-subsidy eroded |
| Digital divide | New form of inequality |
| Solutions | Universal service fund |

### The Innovation Question

| Claim | Counter |
|-------|---------|
| Competition drove innovation | Bell Labs era also innovative |
| Internet needed openness | Some proprietary systems innovated too |
| Deregulation enables | Regulation can enable differently |

## The Deeper Point

Telecommunications deregulation shows how [[Institutions and Progress|institutional choices]] shape technological development. The AT&T monopoly produced Bell Labs—extraordinary basic research. The breakup produced competition—falling prices and new services. Both were institutional designs with different consequences.

The key insight is that "natural monopoly" was always partly a policy choice, not just a technological fact. Technology changed—microwave, fiber, wireless—but so did the rules. MCI's ability to challenge AT&T depended on FCC decisions. BT privatization was political choice. The liberalization wave reflected ideology (market faith) as much as technology (digital convergence).

The internet's openness—common carrier principles, net neutrality, interconnection requirements—was inherited from telecommunications regulation. The institutional rules that governed phone networks created the conditions for internet innovation. Closed networks might have produced different outcomes.

The [[Varieties of Capitalism|varieties of capitalism]] lens illuminates why approaches differed. US antitrust broke up the monopoly. UK privatized but regulated. Continental Europe retained state ownership longer. Japan compromised. These choices reflected different institutional traditions, not just different analysis of the same technology.

Today's platform monopoly debates echo telecommunications history. The "natural monopoly" argument that justified Bell System regulation sounds like the "network effects" argument for platform dominance. The question—regulate, break up, or allow—remains contested institutional territory.
