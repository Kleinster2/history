# Decolonization

Decolonization—the process by which colonial territories gained independence—transformed the world between 1945 and 1975, creating dozens of new nations. The end of European colonial empires resulted from nationalist movements, imperial exhaustion after World War II, Cold War dynamics, and changing ideas about self-determination. Decolonization's economic dimensions include debates about development paths, colonial legacies, and neo-colonialism.

### The Deeper Point

Decolonization revealed the cruelest legacy of [[Imperialism|empire]]: colonial powers built [[Institutions and Progress|extractive institutions]]—export monocultures, coerced labor, racial hierarchies, arbitrary borders—that were designed to transfer wealth outward, not generate it locally. Independence changed the flag but rarely the institutions. New states inherited economies structured to produce raw materials for distant factories, education systems designed to create clerks not entrepreneurs, and borders that divided economic communities while uniting rivals. The countries that escaped this trap (the [[Asian Tigers]], Botswana) did so by *replacing* colonial institutions with developmental ones—state capacity directed toward production rather than extraction. Those that failed ([[Modern Africa|much of Africa]], parts of Latin America) often saw colonial extraction simply replaced by domestic elite extraction. Decolonization's lesson for [[Development Economics]] is that political independence is necessary but not sufficient: the institutional inheritance determines whether sovereignty enables development or merely transfers the beneficiaries of extraction.
