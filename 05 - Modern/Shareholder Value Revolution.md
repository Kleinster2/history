# Shareholder Value Revolution

From managerial capitalism to shareholder primacy. The revolution in corporate purpose—from serving multiple stakeholders to maximizing shareholder value—transformed how companies operate, how executives are paid, and who benefits from corporate profits. Whether this was efficiency gain or value extraction remains contested.

## The Managerial Era (1930s-1970s)

### Berle and Means (1932)

| Observation | Implication |
|-------------|-------------|
| Ownership separated from control | Managers run corporations |
| Dispersed shareholders | Can't monitor effectively |
| Managerial discretion | Managers serve themselves? |
| The Modern Corporation | Power without property |

### The Managerial Corporation

| Feature | Character |
|---------|-----------|
| Professional managers | Career executives |
| Multiple stakeholders | Employees, communities, shareholders |
| Long-term orientation | Growth, stability |
| Retained earnings | Reinvestment |
| "Organization man" | Corporate culture |

### Who Benefited?

| Stakeholder | Treatment |
|-------------|-----------|
| Employees | Job security, pensions, benefits |
| Communities | Corporate responsibility |
| Shareholders | Dividends, but limited returns |
| Managers | Power, status, reasonable pay |

### The Critique

| Problem | Reality |
|---------|---------|
| Empire building | Acquisitions for size |
| Slack | Inefficiency tolerated |
| Conglomerates | Unrelated diversification |
| Returns | Lagged potential |

### LBO Boom

| Effect | Impact on Governance |
|--------|---------------------|
| [[Leveraged Buyouts]] | Concentrated ownership |

### The Message

| Lesson | For Managers |
|--------|-------------|
| Perform or be replaced | Stock price matters |

| Options % of CEO pay | Minimal | 25% | Varies |
| Total CEO compensation | ~$700K | $2.7M | $15M+ |

### The Problems

| Issue | Reality |
|-------|---------|
| Short-termism | Manipulate for option vesting |

| Timing | Backdate options |
| Gaming | Manage earnings, buy back stock |

## Stock Buybacks

### The Mechanism

| 1980s | $50 billion |
| 1990s | $150 billion |
| 2000s | $400 billion |
| 2018 | $800 billion |

### The Critique

| Concern | Reality |
|---------|---------|
| Instead of investment | Capex flat |

| "Profits without prosperity" | Buybacks exceed investment |
| Short-termism | Quarter-to-quarter management |
| Extraction | From workers to shareholders |
| Proposal | Ban or restrict buybacks |

## Short-Termism Debate

### The Concern

| Symptom | Evidence |
|---------|----------|

| Flexibility | Directors have discretion |

### The Revlon Moment

## The Deeper Point

The shareholder value revolution was an [[Institutions and Progress|institutional transformation]] in corporate purpose. The pre-1980 managerial corporation served multiple stakeholders and prioritized growth. The post-1980 shareholder-value corporation serves one constituency and prioritizes returns. This wasn't a discovery of truth—it was an ideological shift embedded in new institutional arrangements: executive compensation, hostile takeovers, buyback rules.

The question is whether this transformation channeled corporate resources more efficiently or merely redistributed them—from workers and communities to shareholders and executives. The efficiency argument: concentrated ownership and aligned incentives reduced agency costs and punished underperformance. The redistribution argument: $800 billion in buybacks could have been wages, investment, or taxes.

The [[Financialization|financialization]] lens suggests that shareholder primacy may be extraction disguised as efficiency. When corporations strip assets, cut investment, and pump stock prices through financial engineering rather than operational improvement, shareholder returns come from value transfer rather than value creation. The declining share of GDP going to labor—concurrent with rising shareholder returns—suggests redistribution is real.

The institutional lesson is that corporate purpose is a choice, not a law of nature. Different institutional rules—German codetermination, Japanese cross-shareholding, pre-1980s American norms—produced different balances. The shareholder value revolution was policy choices (executive compensation rules, buyback legalization, hostile takeover tolerance) that changed who corporations serve. Other choices would produce different outcomes.
