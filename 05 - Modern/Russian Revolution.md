# Russian Revolution

The Russian Revolution of 1917—actually two revolutions (February/March and October/November)—overthrew the Tsarist autocracy and established the world's first communist state. The Bolsheviks under Lenin created a new economic system, centrally planned and state-owned, that would compete with capitalism for the 20th century. The revolution's economic causes (war strain, backwardness, inequality) and consequences (planning experiment, industrialization) make it central to modern economic history.

### The Deeper Point

The Russian Revolution was the 20th century's great test of whether economic development requires market institutions or can be commanded from above. The Bolsheviks inherited a backward agrarian economy and, through extraordinary coercion, built an industrial superpower in two decades—proving that forced savings and central direction *can* industrialize. But the [[Soviet Economy]]'s subsequent stagnation proved something more fundamental: you can command steel production but not innovation. Markets aren't just allocation mechanisms; they're *discovery processes* that reveal what's worth producing. Without prices, profits, and competition, the USSR could copy Western technology but never lead it. This is the vault's [[Institutions and Progress|institutional thesis]] in its starkest form: extractive institutions can mobilize resources but cannot sustain the creative destruction that drives long-run growth.
