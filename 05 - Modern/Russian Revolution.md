# Russian Revolution

The Russian Revolution of 1917—actually two revolutions (February/March and October/November)—overthrew the Tsarist autocracy and established the world's first communist state. The Bolsheviks under Lenin created a new economic system, centrally planned and state-owned, that would compete with capitalism for the 20th century. The revolution's economic causes (war strain, backwardness, inequality) and consequences (planning experiment, industrialization) make it central to modern economic history.
