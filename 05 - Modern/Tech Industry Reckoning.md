# Tech Industry Reckoning

From "don't be evil" to congressional hearings. Between 2016 and 2024, the technology industry went from celebrated disruptor to suspected villain. The 2016 election, Cambridge Analytica, content moderation failures, monopoly concerns, and child safety fears transformed Big Tech's relationship with society. Governments worldwide launched antitrust cases, passed new regulations, and questioned whether platforms had become too powerful. This reckoning hasn't broken Big Tech—revenues and profits remain enormous—but it has ended the era of uncritical admiration and permissive regulation.

## The Turning Point: 2016

## The Deeper Point

The tech reckoning reveals the tension between innovation and accountability that defines capitalism's relationship with [[Institutions and Progress|institutions]]. The same permissive environment that enabled Google, Facebook, and Amazon to grow also enabled the harms that sparked backlash. Light regulation was a feature, not a bug, of [[American Business Strategy]]—and it produced both extraordinary innovation and extraordinary concentration.

The regulatory response shows institutions catching up to technology. The EU moved first and most comprehensively (GDPR, DMA, DSA). The US fragmented along partisan lines—Republicans focused on "censorship," Democrats on monopoly and privacy. China cracked down harshly on its own tech giants. None of these approaches has clearly broken Big Tech's power; all have constrained its freedom of action.

The deeper question is whether the techlash produces reform or just friction. Antitrust cases take years; companies adapt. Privacy laws impose costs but don't fundamentally change business models. Content moderation remains impossible at scale. The reckoning has changed the *narrative* around tech—from hero to villain—but not yet the *structure* of the industry. Whether it eventually does depends on whether institutional reform can match the speed of technological change.
