# Climate and Economy

The same process that created modern prosperity—burning fossil fuels to power machines—is destabilizing the climate system. This is the central paradox of economic progress: the [[Industrial Revolution]] that freed humanity from poverty now threatens its future. Climate change is not just an environmental problem; it is the largest economic challenge in history, requiring the transformation of the entire energy system, industrial base, and consumption pattern that took 250 years to build. Whether growth can continue while decarbonizing—or whether the growth model itself must change—is the defining economic question of the 21st century.

## Overview

### The Paradox

| Achievement | Consequence |
|-------------|-------------|
| Fossil-fueled growth | CO2 from 280 → 420 ppm |
| Industrial prosperity | 1.2°C warming (and rising) |
| Energy abundance | Climate destabilization |
| Mass consumption | Resource depletion |
| Global development | Emissions still rising |

### Timeline

| Period | Character |
|--------|-----------|
| 1750-1950 | Fossil buildup (coal, then oil) |
| 1950-1990 | Great Acceleration (emissions explode) |
| 1988-2005 | Awareness (IPCC, Kyoto) |
| 2005-2015 | Failed action, rising urgency |
| 2015-present | Paris Agreement, energy transition begins |

## The Carbon Economy

### How Fossil Fuels Built the Modern World

| Fuel | Era | What It Enabled |
|------|-----|-----------------|
| Coal | 1760-1950 | [[Steam Engine]], railroads, electricity |
| Oil | 1900-present | Automobiles, aviation, plastics, chemicals |
| Gas | 1950-present | Electricity, heating, fertilizer |
| Together | | 80% of world energy (2023) |

### The Great Acceleration (1950-present)

| Measure | 1950 | 2023 |
|---------|------|------|
| CO2 emissions (Gt/year) | 6 | 37 |
| World GDP | $4 trillion | $100 trillion |
| Population | 2.5 billion | 8 billion |
| Energy use | Low | 4x increase |
| Correlation | GDP growth ≈ emissions growth (until recently) |

### Who Emitted

| Group | Cumulative Share |
|-------|-----------------|
| US + EU | ~50% of historical emissions |
| China | ~13% (but now #1 annual) |
| Rest of world | ~37% |
| Tension | Rich countries caused it; poor countries suffer most |

### Carbon Lock-In

| Mechanism | How It Traps |
|-----------|--------------|
| Infrastructure | Power plants last 40 years |
| Urban form | Suburbs need cars |
| Industrial processes | Steel, cement need heat |
| Agriculture | Fertilizer from gas |
| Finance | Fossil fuel assets worth trillions |

## The Economics of Climate Damage

### The Stern Review (2006)

| Argument | Detail |
|----------|--------|
| Climate change = market failure | Externality not priced |
| Cost of inaction | 5-20% of GDP permanently |
| Cost of action | 1-2% of GDP now |
| Conclusion | Cheaper to act than wait |
| Controversy | Discount rate debate |

### Economic Damages

| Impact | Mechanism |
|--------|-----------|
| Agriculture | Droughts, floods, heat stress |
| Infrastructure | Sea rise, storms, fire |
| Health | Heat deaths, disease range |
| Migration | Climate refugees |
| Conflict | Resource competition |
| Finance | Stranded assets, insurance crisis |

### Who Pays

| Vulnerability | Example |
|---------------|---------|
| Small island states | Existential (sea level) |
| Sub-Saharan Africa | Least responsible, most exposed |
| South/Southeast Asia | Floods, heat, density |
| Arctic regions | Fastest warming |
| Wealthy nations | Expensive adaptation, but affordable |

### The Discount Rate Debate

| Position | Implication |
|----------|-------------|
| High discount rate (Nordhaus) | Future damage worth less today; go slow |
| Low discount rate (Stern) | Future matters nearly as much; act fast |
| Zero/negative (ethics) | Future generations have equal rights |
| Stakes | Determines trillions in policy |

## Policy Approaches

### Carbon Pricing

| Mechanism | How It Works |
|-----------|--------------|
| Carbon tax | Direct price on emissions |
| Cap and trade | Market sets price (EU ETS, 2005) |
| Border adjustment | Tax imports from non-pricing countries |
| Coverage | ~23% of global emissions priced (2023) |
| Problem | Prices too low, too many exemptions |

### Regulation

| Tool | Example |
|------|---------|
| Efficiency standards | Vehicle fuel economy, building codes |
| Phase-outs | Coal plants, ICE vehicle bans |
| Mandates | Renewable portfolio standards |
| Bans | Single-use plastics, HFCs |

### Industrial Policy

| Approach | Example |
|----------|---------|
| Subsidies | US IRA ($370 billion), EU Green Deal |
| R&D funding | Battery research, fusion, hydrogen |
| Public investment | Grid modernization, charging |
| Green banks | Concessional finance |
| State direction | China's solar/EV industrial policy |

### International Agreements

| Agreement | Character |
|-----------|-----------|
| Rio (1992) | Framework, no targets |
| Kyoto (1997) | Rich country targets, US withdrew |
| Copenhagen (2009) | Failed binding agreement |
| Paris (2015) | Universal, voluntary, bottom-up |
| Glasgow (2021) | Phase-down coal, methane pledge |
| Problem | Pledges insufficient for 1.5°C |

## The Energy Transition

### What Must Change

| Sector | Challenge |
|--------|-----------|
| Electricity (25%) | Easiest—renewables competitive |
| Transport (16%) | EVs advancing, aviation/shipping hard |
| Industry (21%) | Steel, cement, chemicals—very hard |
| Buildings (6%) | Heat pumps, efficiency |
| Agriculture (10%) | Methane, land use, diet |

### Renewable Revolution

| Evidence | Some rich countries have (modestly) |
| Degrowth | Growth itself is the problem |
| Critique | Decoupling too slow, rebound effects |
| Developing world | Need growth AND clean tech |

### Decoupling

| Type | Status |
|------|--------|
| Relative | Emissions grow slower than GDP (happening) |
| Absolute | Emissions fall while GDP grows (some countries) |
| Sufficient | Fast enough for 1.5°C? (probably not yet) |

### Historical Parallels

| Transition | Duration | Lesson |
|------------|----------|--------|
| Wood → coal | 100+ years | Slow |
| Coal → oil | 50-80 years | Faster |
| Current | Need 20-30 years | Unprecedented speed required |
| Difference | Previous transitions added fuels; this one must replace |

## The Deeper Point

Climate change is the ultimate test of whether [[Institutions and Progress|institutional]] frameworks designed for a fossil-fuel era can manage a transition driven by *choice* rather than *constraint*. Every previous [[Energy History|energy transition]] was demand-driven: wood scarcity pushed coal ([[Timber Crisis]]), coal's immobility pushed oil, kerosene's obsolescence for lighting pushed gasoline for transport. In each case, the new source was *better* for users—cheaper, more convenient, more powerful. The renewable transition is unprecedented because the incumbent system still works profitably for those using it; the costs are externalized to the future and to others. This means the transition requires institutional force—carbon pricing, regulation, subsidy—rather than market pull. The [[Innovation Economics|innovation]] challenge is real (storage, grid, industrial heat, aviation), but the deeper problem is political: fossil fuel incumbents have concentrated interests in blocking [[Creative Destruction|creative destruction]], while the beneficiaries of decarbonization are diffuse and future. This is Olson's collective action problem at civilizational scale. The question isn't whether renewables can work (they can) but whether existing [[State Capacity|state capacity]] and international institutions can impose costs on the present for the benefit of the future—something no political system has ever done at this scale without the pressure of immediate crisis.
