# Latin American Development

Latin America's economic history is a puzzle: rich in resources, independent since the 1820s, yet never achieving the prosperity of North America or Western Europe. From colonial extraction to commodity dependence, from import substitution to debt crisis, from neoliberalism to the "pink tide," the region has tried many paths. Its persistent inequality and vulnerability to commodity cycles define its distinctive development challenge.

## Overview

### The Puzzle

| Factor | Latin America |
|--------|---------------|
| Resources | Abundant |
| Independence | Early (1820s) |
| European settlement | Significant |
| Yet | Middle-income, unequal |

### Key Countries

| Country | GDP (2023) | Character |
|---------|------------|-----------|
| Brazil | $2.1 trillion | Giant, diverse |
| Mexico | $1.4 trillion | NAFTA integrated |
| Argentina | $630 billion | Boom and bust |
| Colombia | $340 billion | Emerging |
| Chile | $340 billion | Model (disputed) |

## The Deeper Point

Latin America is the great counter-example to the institutional optimists: independent for 200 years, rich in resources, with formal constitutions modeled on the US and France—yet persistently unequal, commodity-dependent, and unable to sustain growth. Engerman and Sokoloff's thesis explains why: colonial institutions created for sugar/mining extraction (extreme inequality, coerced labor, concentrated land) persisted through independence because the elites who led independence movements had no incentive to dismantle the structures that benefited them. [[Institutions and Progress|Institutional]] path dependence meant that formal political change (republic replaces colony) left economic structures intact—[[Property Rights|property rights]] protected *existing* holdings rather than enabling *new* entry, legal systems served elites rather than enforcing contracts for all, and [[State Capacity|state capacity]] remained oriented toward extraction rather than service. Import substitution (1930s-1980s) was a genuine attempt to build industrial institutions, but without [[Creative Destruction|creative destruction]] (protected industries never faced competition) it produced inefficiency and rent-seeking rather than innovation. The region's oscillation between statism and [[Neoliberalism|neoliberalism]] reflects the absence of a stable institutional settlement: neither protecting incumbents nor removing all protections produces sustained, broadly shared growth. The [[Inequality|inequality]] that colonial institutions created reproduces itself through [[Human Capital|human capital]] deprivation—unequal education → unequal opportunity → unequal political power → policies that perpetuate inequality. Breaking this cycle requires precisely the kind of institutional revolution that existing elites resist.
