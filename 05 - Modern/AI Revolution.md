# AI Revolution

From neural network winter to ChatGPT. Artificial intelligence spent decades as a field of unfulfilled promises—expert systems that weren't expert, neural networks that couldn't scale. Then, between 2012 and 2024, everything changed. Deep learning cracked image recognition, language models learned to write, and generative AI captured public imagination. The AI revolution may prove as transformative as the internet—or may be another cycle of hype. Either way, it's already reshaping the technology industry and raising questions about labor, creativity, and the nature of intelligence.

## The Long Winter (1970-2012)

### AI's Boom-Bust Cycles

| Era | Promise | Reality |
|-----|---------|---------|
| 1956-1973 | "Machines will think" | Couldn't handle complexity |
| 1980s | Expert systems | Brittle, expensive to maintain |
| 1990s | Neural networks | Couldn't scale, computing too weak |
| 2000s | Statistical ML | Useful but narrow |

### Why AI Kept Failing

| Limitation | Effect |
|------------|--------|
| Computing power | Neural networks needed more than existed |
| Data | Training required datasets that didn't exist |
| Algorithms | Backpropagation worked but couldn't go deep |
| Funding | Winters followed each hype cycle |

### The Survivors

| Researcher | Contribution | Institution |
|------------|--------------|-------------|
| Geoffrey Hinton | Deep learning pioneer | Toronto, Google |
| Yann LeCun | Convolutional neural networks | NYU, Meta |
| Yoshua Bengio | Deep learning theory | Montreal |
| Fei-Fei Li | ImageNet dataset | Stanford |

## The Deep Learning Breakthrough (2012)

### ImageNet Moment

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| 2012 | AlexNet wins ImageNet competition |
| Margin | 10% better than next best (error: 15% vs. 25%) |
| Method | Deep convolutional neural network |
| Hardware | GPUs (Nvidia) |
| Team | Hinton, Krizhevsky, Sutskever (Toronto) |

### Why This Time Was Different

| Factor | What Changed |
|--------|--------------|
| GPUs | Nvidia hardware enabled parallel computation |
| Data | ImageNet provided millions of labeled images |
| Algorithms | Dropout, ReLU, better training techniques |
| Scale | Deeper networks actually worked |

### The Proof Points

| Year | Achievement |
|------|-------------|
| 2012 | Image recognition (AlexNet) |
| 2014 | Image generation (GANs) |
| 2015 | Speech recognition (near-human) |
| 2016 | Game playing (AlphaGo beats Lee Sedol) |
| 2017 | Translation (Transformer architecture) |

## The Industry Mobilizes (2013-2017)

### The Acquisitions

| Company | Acquired | Year | Price |
|---------|----------|------|-------|
| Google | DeepMind | 2014 | $500M |
| Google | Hinton's company | 2013 | Unknown |
| Facebook | LeCun joins | 2013 | — |
| Apple | Multiple AI startups | 2015+ | Various |
| Microsoft | Multiple | 2016+ | Various |

### The Talent War

| Dynamic | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| PhD salaries | $500K-$1M+ for top researchers |
| Acqui-hires | Buy companies for teams |
| University raids | Professors join industry |
| H-1B competition | Immigration as competitive advantage |

### Corporate AI Labs

| Lab | Parent | Focus |
|-----|--------|-------|
| Google Brain | Google | General AI research |
| DeepMind | Google | AGI, games, science |
| FAIR | Meta | Open research |
| Microsoft Research | Microsoft | Applied AI |
| OpenAI | Independent (then Microsoft) | AGI safety |

### OpenAI's Unusual Path

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| 2015 | Founded as nonprofit (Musk, Altman, others) |
| 2018 | Musk departs after failed takeover attempt |
| 2019 | Pivots to "capped-profit" structure |
| 2019 | Microsoft invests $1B |
| 2023 | Microsoft invests additional $10B |
| Nov 2023 | Board fires then reinstates Altman |

OpenAI's governance decisions shaped the AI industry. Musk co-founded it to counter Google's AI dominance, then left when he couldn't control it. His departure forced the commercial pivot that enabled GPT-4. The irony: Musk founded OpenAI to prevent AI concentration, then his exit accelerated the Microsoft partnership he now criticizes.

## The Deeper Point

The AI revolution reveals a familiar pattern: breakthrough technology enabling winner-take-all concentration. Nvidia captured compute, OpenAI captured mindshare, and the cloud giants captured infrastructure. The question is whether this concentration will persist or face the same disruption that toppled previous tech giants.

The [[Silicon Valley Model]]'s elements are all present: venture capital funding breakthrough research, talent concentration in a few labs, network effects from data and compute, and ecosystem lock-in from APIs and fine-tuning. But the AI era also shows new dynamics: the importance of compute scale means only well-funded incumbents can compete at the frontier; the safety concerns create regulatory leverage that could advantage incumbents; and the global nature of AI research means geographic concentration may matter less than in previous eras.

The institutional question connects to [[Institutions and Progress]]: who will capture AI's gains? If AI increases productivity, will workers share in the benefits (higher wages, shorter hours) or will gains flow to capital owners and the few companies controlling the technology? Historical automation waves eventually raised living standards broadly, but the transition periods were painful. Whether AI follows this pattern or breaks it depends on institutional choices about education, labor markets, and redistribution—choices being made now.
