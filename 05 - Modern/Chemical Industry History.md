# Chemical Industry History

Germany dominated the chemical industry from 1870 to 1945—not by accident, but through institutional infrastructure: research universities, patent protection, corporate laboratories, and the scale to exploit them. Synthetic dyes became the foundation; pharmaceuticals, fertilizers, and explosives followed. The chemical industry shows how innovation becomes institutionalized: not lone inventors but organized R&D, not craft secrets but systematic science, not lucky discoveries but designed research programs.

## Overview

| Period | Development |
|--------|-------------|
| Pre-1850 | Alchemical, small-scale |
| 1850-1870 | First synthetic dyes |
| 1870-1914 | German dominance established |
| 1914-1945 | Wartime chemistry, cartels |
| Post-1945 | Petrochemicals, global industry |

## Early Development

### The Dye Breakthrough

## The Deeper Point

The chemical industry shows [[Innovation Economics|innovation]] becoming institutionalized. Before 1850, invention was individual and accidental (Perkin found mauveine while failing to synthesize quinine). After German systematization, innovation was organized: corporate laboratories with research programs, universities training chemists, patents incentivizing disclosure, scale economies rewarding investment. Germany dominated not because of superior individual genius but because it built the [[Institutions and Progress|institutional infrastructure]] for systematic innovation. Research universities produced basic science; technical schools trained applied chemists; corporate labs converted knowledge to products; patents protected investment in R&D. The Haber-Bosch process exemplifies this: years of directed research, massive capital investment, breakthrough with global consequences (synthetic nitrogen feeds half the world today). Other countries eventually caught up by copying German institutions—US chemical firms after WWI built their own research labs. The lesson: innovation at scale requires institutions, not just inventors. The lone genius model (Perkin, Edison) gave way to the corporate lab model (BASF, DuPont, Bell Labs). The chemical industry proved that science could be industrialized.
