# Containerization

The shipping container—a simple steel box—revolutionized global trade. Before containers, loading and unloading ships was labor-intensive, slow, theft-prone, and expensive. After containers, a ship that took weeks to unload could be turned around in hours. Transport costs for manufactured goods fell by 90% or more. This single innovation enabled global supply chains, Asian export industrialization, and the consumer abundance of wealthy countries. Containerization made distance nearly irrelevant for manufactured goods—and reshaped economies, cities, and labor markets worldwide.

## Overview

### The Revolution in Numbers

| Metric | Before (1950s) | After (2000s) |
|--------|----------------|---------------|
| Ship turnaround | Days to weeks | Hours |
| Loading cost | $5.86/ton | $0.16/ton |
| Theft rate | High | Near zero |
| Port labor | Thousands per port | Hundreds |
| Trade share of GDP | ~10% | ~25%+ |

### What Changed

| Before (Break-Bulk) | After (Container) |
|---------------------|-------------------|
| Individual packages | Standardized boxes |
| Manual handling | Crane operations |
| Multiple handlings | Door-to-door sealed |
| Port warehousing | Intermodal flow |
| Labor-intensive | Capital-intensive |

| Mechanization and Modernization | 1960 agreement |
| Union accepted containers | In exchange for guarantees |
| No layoffs | Attrition, early retirement |
| Wage increases | Remaining workers well paid |
| Legacy | Template for automation deals |

### Resistance Elsewhere

| Location | Outcome |
|----------|---------|
| East Coast ILA | Resisted longer |
| UK | Prolonged strikes |

## The Deeper Point

Containerization demonstrates how [[Institutions and Progress|institutional]] and technological innovation combine to transform economies. The technology—standardized boxes, cranes, ships—was necessary but not sufficient. Equally important were: international standardization (ISO sizes), regulatory accommodation (customs procedures), labor agreements (ILWU deal), infrastructure investment (new ports), and business model innovation (intermodal integration). [[Entrepreneurship|Entrepreneurial]] energy (McLean's insight, shipping line competition) was channeled by these institutions toward productive investment in logistics efficiency. The consequences were profound: container shipping made possible [[Globalization|globalization]] of manufacturing, enabling the Asian export model and [[Developmental State|developmental states]] to industrialize through trade. It also destroyed traditional dockwork, hollowed out urban waterfronts, and contributed to manufacturing job losses in developed countries. The same innovation that created abundance also created disruption. The COVID-era supply chain crisis revealed the fragility beneath the efficiency: systems optimized for normal flow proved brittle under stress. Containerization is [[Creative Destruction]] in infrastructure—enormously beneficial in aggregate, deeply disruptive in particular. The question going forward is whether the system can adapt to new challenges—decarbonization, geopolitical fragmentation, resilience demands—or whether a new transformation awaits.
