# Middle Eastern Business

Middle Eastern business developed at the intersection of bazaar traditions, oil wealth, and Islamic finance. Family conglomerates dominate from Morocco to the Gulf, but the region divides between oil-rich rentier states where business means proximity to ruling families, and oil-poor economies where traditional merchant classes and newer entrepreneurs compete. Islamic finance has created a parallel financial system serving 2 billion Muslims. The business environment is shaped by the [[Resource Curse|resource curse]]: where oil flows, business becomes about state connections; where it doesn't, genuine commercial traditions survive.

## The Deeper Point

Middle Eastern business is bifurcated by oil: in the Gulf, the [[Resource Curse|resource curse]] means business success depends on proximity to ruling families who control oil revenue distribution; in oil-poor economies, more traditional commercial dynamics survive but within weak institutional frameworks. The rentier state model inverts the normal business-government relationship: instead of government taxing business, government distributes to business—which makes political connection, not competitive capability, the source of success. This channels [[Entrepreneurship|entrepreneurial]] ambition toward capturing state favor rather than serving customers. Islamic finance represents an institutional innovation—a parallel financial system serving religious requirements—but debates continue about whether it differs substantively from conventional finance or merely relabels the same practices. The [[Varieties of Capitalism]] framework struggles with the region: Gulf states are neither LME nor CME but *rentier capitalism*, where the state's distributive role makes standard categories inapplicable. Dubai's diversification success suggests escape from the resource curse is possible with sufficient [[State Capacity|state capacity]] and strategic vision, but requires the rare combination of sovereign wealth, competent technocracy, and geographic advantage. The deeper pattern: where oil revenue flows, business becomes about distribution rather than production; where it doesn't, commercial traditions persist but face [[Institutions and Progress|institutional]] constraints that limit development. The bazaar merchants who traded across the region for centuries now operate in the shadow of oil states whose rentier logic transforms what business means.
