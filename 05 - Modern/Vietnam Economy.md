# Vietnam Economy

Vietnam's economic history is a story of resilience through colonialism, war, and ideological experiment. French exploitation gave way to decades of conflict, then failed socialist planning, and finally a market transition that produced one of Asia's fastest-growing economies. From rice paddies to electronics factories, Vietnam became a model of post-communist development.
