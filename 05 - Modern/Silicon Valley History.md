# Silicon Valley History

From orchards to algorithms. The Santa Clara Valley's transformation from agricultural backwater to global technology capital is one of the most consequential economic stories of the twentieth century. What began with a radio oscillator in a Palo Alto garage became an ecosystem that produces trillion-dollar companies and reshapes how humanity lives. This is the chronological story of how it happened.

## The Deeper Point

Silicon Valley's history reveals a pattern: each era built on the previous one's infrastructure, talent, and capital. Terman's students founded HP; HP's success attracted defense contracts; defense contracts funded semiconductor research; semiconductor engineers founded Fairchild; Fairchild alumni founded Intel, AMD, National; their success attracted venture capital; VC funded Apple; Apple's success created the PC industry; PC wealth funded internet startups; internet success created the platform giants.

Each transition involved [[Creative Destruction]]—the PC disrupted mainframes, the internet disrupted media, mobile disrupted everything—but the *location* persisted. The network effects were geographic: talent stayed because opportunities were here; opportunities were here because talent stayed. The [[Silicon Valley Model]] explains the institutional configuration that enabled this; the history shows how it accumulated over eight decades.

The question now is whether remote work and cost pressure will finally break the geographic concentration. History suggests caution: similar predictions after the dot-com crash proved wrong. But the forces pushing outward—$2M median home prices, no non-competes in other states now, remote-friendly tools—are stronger than before. Silicon Valley may become less a place and more a network. Or the agglomeration effects may prove so powerful that the cluster persists despite everything. The next chapter is being written now.
