# Technology Industry

The technology industry is capitalism's most dramatic demonstration of [[Creative Destruction|creative destruction]]—and its periodic suspension. From IBM's mainframe monopoly through the PC revolution to today's platform giants, tech has alternated between long periods of incumbent dominance and sudden paradigm shifts that reshape the industry entirely. Network effects, switching costs, and ecosystem lock-in create winner-take-all dynamics that favor first movers and scale. Yet each technological paradigm eventually yields to the next: mainframes to PCs, PCs to internet, internet to mobile, and now perhaps to AI. The question is whether today's giants (Apple, Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Meta) will follow IBM's path—dominant until disrupted—or whether their platform positions are more durable.

## The Deeper Point

The technology industry demonstrates [[Creative Destruction|creative destruction]]'s paradoxical relationship with competition: each technological paradigm produces winner-take-all dynamics that suspend competitive pressure until the next paradigm arrives. IBM dominated mainframes for decades until PCs disrupted the model; Microsoft dominated PCs until mobile and cloud shifted the game; today's platform giants control ecosystems that seem equally durable—until AI or some other shift enables the next displacement. The [[Antitrust History|antitrust]] question is whether these platform monopolies are temporary (awaiting disruption) or permanent (requiring intervention). Network effects create genuine consumer value—Facebook is more useful because your friends are there—but also barriers that make market entry nearly impossible. The [[Varieties of Capitalism]] framework applies differently here: the US light-touch approach produced global platform dominance; EU regulation-first approach protected privacy but produced no tech giants; China's state-guided competition created domestic champions but at the cost of innovation freedom. [[Intellectual Property]] matters less here than in pharma—tech advantages come from scale and network effects more than patents—though standard-essential patents and software IP create their own battlegrounds. The deeper insight: tech shows that [[Entrepreneurship|entrepreneurial]] ambition channeled by network economics produces both unprecedented innovation and unprecedented concentration. The question for [[Business Regulation|regulators]] is whether to accept this dynamic (allowing creative destruction to eventually discipline today's giants) or to intervene (potentially slowing innovation while reducing concentration). Neither answer is clearly correct.
