# Mass Production

Mass production transformed economic life more than any innovation since agriculture. When Henry Ford's assembly line made the Model T affordable, it proved a revolutionary idea: pay workers enough to buy what they make, and the whole economy grows. This "Fordist bargain" defined the 20th century—high wages, high output, mass consumption. Then Toyota improved it, China scaled it, and robots began replacing it.

## Overview

### The Transformation

| Measure | Before (1900) | After (1970) |
|---------|---------------|--------------|
| Car production time | 12+ hours | 1 hour |
| Car price (real) | Years of income | Months of income |
| Factory workers | Skilled craftsmen | Semi-skilled operators |
| Output per worker | Low | 10-50x higher |

### Key Innovations

| Innovation | Pioneer | Date |
|------------|---------|------|

### How It Differed from Ford

| Dimension | Ford | Toyota |
|-----------|------|--------|
| Inventory | Large buffers | Minimal (JIT) |
| Quality | Inspect at end | Build in at source |
| Workers | Interchangeable | Multi-skilled teams |
| Improvement | Management-driven | Worker-driven (kaizen) |
| Variety | One model | Many models, same line |

### Results

| Measure | Toyota Advantage |
|---------|------------------|
| Defects | 10x fewer |
| Inventory | 90% less |
| Development time | Half |
| Worker suggestions | 100x more |
