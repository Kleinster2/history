# Post-Colonial Institutional Paths

Decolonization offered a moment of institutional choice. Newly independent nations inherited colonial administrative structures, legal systems, and economic patterns—but they could, in principle, reform them. Some did: Korea and Taiwan implemented land reform; Singapore built a developmental state; Botswana managed diamonds wisely. Most didn't: colonial extraction patterns persisted through new elites, or reform attempts failed against entrenched interests and weak state capacity. Understanding why decolonization produced such divergent outcomes—from the Asian Tigers' miracle to much of Africa's stagnation—is central to [[Development Economics]].

## Overview

### The Moment of Independence

| Inheritance | Possibility |
|-------------|-------------|
| Colonial borders | New nation-building |
| Extractive institutions | Reform opportunity |
| Thin administration | Capacity constraint |
| Educated elite (small) | Leadership pool |
| Export dependence | Diversification chance |

### Divergent Outcomes

| Path | Examples | Result |
|------|----------|--------|
| Developmental state | Korea, Taiwan, Singapore | Rapid growth |
| Socialist planning | Tanzania, Ghana, Cuba | Stagnation |
| Continued extraction | Congo, Nigeria | Poverty |
| Gradual reform | India, Malaysia | Mixed |
| Resource dependence | Venezuela, Angola | Boom-bust |

## The Colonial Inheritance

### What Colonies Left Behind

| Dimension | Extractive Colonies | Settler Colonies |
|-----------|--------------------|--------------------|
| Administration | Thin, extraction-focused | Developed, service-oriented |
| Education | Elite only | Broader (for settlers) |
| Infrastructure | Export-oriented (ports, rails) | Internal development |
| Legal system | Property for colonizers | Rule of law (for settlers) |
| Political institutions | Authoritarian | Some representation |

### The Persistence Problem

| Mechanism | How It Worked |
|-----------|---------------|
| Elite continuity | Colonial-educated elite took over |
| Institutional inertia | Easier to use existing structures |
| Economic dependence | Export patterns locked in |
| State weakness | Couldn't implement alternatives |
| External pressure | Creditors, former colonizers |

## Major Institutional Paths

### Path 1: Developmental State (East Asia)

| Feature | Implementation |
|---------|----------------|
| Land reform | Broke colonial/feudal inequality |
| State-directed industrialization | Credit allocation, protection |
| Export discipline | Had to compete globally |
| Education investment | Broad-based human capital |
| Authoritarian politics | Stability for development |
| See | [[Developmental State]] |

**Why East Asia Succeeded:**
| Factor | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| Japanese colonial legacy | Built infrastructure, education |
| Cold War | US support, aid, market access |
| External threat | North Korea, China pressure |
| Land reform | Broke old elite |
| Confucian culture? | Debated |

### Path 2: Import Substitution (Latin America, South Asia)

| Feature | Implementation |
|---------|----------------|
| Protection | High tariffs on manufactured imports |
| State enterprises | Create industry directly |
| Planning | Allocate investment centrally |
| Inward orientation | Domestic market focus |
| See | [[Development Economics]] |

**Why ISI Struggled:**
| Problem | Consequence |
|---------|-------------|
| No export discipline | Inefficiency tolerated |
| Rent-seeking | Protection captured by business |
| Overvalued currency | Agriculture penalized |
| Debt accumulation | 1980s crisis |
| Inequality unchanged | Land not reformed |

### Path 3: African Socialism

| Feature | Implementation |
|---------|----------------|
| State control | Marketing boards, nationalization |
| One-party rule | Development through unity |
| Ujamaa (Tanzania) | Villagization, collectivization |
| Nkrumahism (Ghana) | State-led industrialization |
| See | [[Modern Africa]] |

**Why African Socialism Failed:**
| Problem | Consequence |
|---------|-------------|
| State capacity | Too weak to implement |
| Extraction | Marketing boards taxed farmers |
| No accountability | Authoritarian without development |
| Ideology over pragmatism | Collectivization failed |
| External shocks | Oil, commodity prices |

### Path 4: Resource Dependence

| Feature | Implementation |
|---------|----------------|
| Export commodity | Oil, minerals, agriculture |
| State capture | Revenue to elite |
| Dutch disease | Currency appreciation kills manufacturing |
| Boom-bust | Volatile planning |
| See | [[Resource Curse]] |

**Examples:**
| Country | Resource | Outcome |
|---------|----------|---------|
| Nigeria | Oil | Corruption, conflict |
| Venezuela | Oil | Boom, then collapse |
| Botswana | Diamonds | Exception—managed well |
| Chile | Copper | Relatively well managed |

## Critical Junctures

### When Institutions Changed

| Country | Moment | Change |
|---------|--------|--------|
| Korea (1948-50) | Land reform | Broke landlord class |
| India (1991) | Liberalization | Ended License Raj |
| China (1978) | Reform and opening | Market mechanisms |
| Chile (1973/1990) | Coup/democracy | Neoliberal turn |
| Vietnam (1986) | Doi Moi | Market socialism |

### What Enabled Change

| Factor | Mechanism |
|--------|-----------|
| Crisis | Old system clearly failing |
| Leadership | Visionary reformers |
| External pressure | IMF, World Bank, or aid |
| Coalition change | New groups in power |
| Demonstration effect | Seeing neighbors succeed |

### What Blocked Change

| Factor | Mechanism |
|--------|-----------|
| Elite resistance | Beneficiaries of status quo |
| State weakness | Can't implement reform |
| External intervention | Coups (Guatemala 1954) |
| Ethnic politics | Reform threatens groups |
| Ideology | Commitment to failed model |

## Case Comparisons

### Korea vs. Philippines

| Dimension | Korea | Philippines |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| Colonial legacy | Japanese (developmental) | Spanish/American (extractive) |
| Land reform | Yes, comprehensive | No, blocked by landlords |
| State capacity | High, bureaucratic quality | Low, politicized |
| Business | State-disciplined chaebol | Oligarch families |
| Outcome | Rich | Middle income |

### India vs. China

| Dimension | India | China |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Starting point | Democratic, federal | Authoritarian, centralized |
| Initial path | Planning, License Raj | Communist, collective |
| Reform | 1991 liberalization | 1978 opening |
| Growth | Moderate, then accelerating | Rapid, sustained |
| Politics | Messy democracy | Efficient authoritarianism? |

### Botswana vs. Nigeria

| Dimension | Botswana | Nigeria |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| Resource | Diamonds | Oil |

## The Washington Consensus Experiment

### What It Prescribed (1990s)

| Policy | Rationale |
|--------|-----------|
| Fiscal discipline | Stop deficits |
| Privatization | Efficient private sector |
| Trade liberalization | Comparative advantage |
| Deregulation | Remove barriers |
| Property rights | Investment security |

### Why It Disappointed

| Problem | Manifestation |
|---------|---------------|
| Premature liberalization | Industries died before maturing |
| Privatization to cronies | Oligarchs, not competition |
| Ignored institutions | Assumed markets emerge |
| Sequencing wrong | Opened capital before institutions |
| One-size-fits-all | Ignored local conditions |

### The Counter-Examples

| Country | Violated Consensus | Result |
|---------|-------------------|--------|
| China | State ownership, capital controls | Success |
| Vietnam | Gradual, state-guided | Success |
| Korea | Industrial policy | Already succeeded |
| India (1990s) | Gradual opening | Growth accelerated |

## Contemporary Paths

### The New Developmentalism

| Feature | Examples |
|---------|----------|
| Industrial policy revival | Ethiopia, Rwanda |
| Infrastructure investment | BRI participation |
| State-owned enterprises | Retained, reformed |
| Technology focus | Digital leapfrogging |
| Pragmatic mix | Markets + state direction |

### Remaining Challenges

| Challenge | Dimension |
|-----------|-----------|
| State capacity | Still weak in many places |
| Elite capture | Extraction continues |
| External constraints | Debt, WTO rules |
| Climate | Development within carbon limits |
| Demography | Youth bulges, aging |

## The Deeper Point

Post-colonial institutional paths demonstrate the [[Institutions and Progress|institutional]] thesis at its starkest: same moment of independence, radically different choices, wildly divergent outcomes. Korea and Ghana had similar income in 1960; today Korea is rich and Ghana remains poor. The difference isn't geography, culture, or resources—it's the institutional choices made at and after independence. But "choice" is too voluntary a word: path dependence, colonial legacies, elite interests, state capacity, and external pressures all constrained what was possible. The [[Developmental State]] wasn't chosen from a menu—it emerged from specific conditions (land reform, external threat, bureaucratic inheritance, Cold War support) that most countries didn't have. The lesson isn't that Africa or Latin America "chose wrong"—it's that institutional change is brutally difficult, and the conditions that enable productive paths are rare. [[Decolonization]] opened a window; for most countries, the window closed quickly as colonial extraction patterns re-emerged through new elites. Breaking those patterns required either exceptional leadership (Botswana), external shock (East Asian Cold War dynamics), or crisis that discredited the old system (India 1991, China 1978). The [[Development Economics]] field's evolution from confident prescription to humble experimentation reflects the hard lesson that institutions can't be imported—they must be built, and the building is the hard part.
