# Great Depression Deep Dive

The defining crisis of the 20th century. The Great Depression showed that markets can collapse catastrophically—the question became what [[Institutions and Progress|institutions]] prevent or cause such failures.

## The Crash

### October 1929

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| October 24 ("Black Thursday") | 12.9 million shares traded, panic selling |
| October 28 ("Black Monday") | Dow drops 13% |
| October 29 ("Black Tuesday") | 16 million shares, Dow drops 12% |
| By November 13 | Dow down 39% from September peak |

### The Decline Continued

| Date | Dow Jones Level | Decline from Peak |
|------|-----------------|-------------------|
| September 1929 | 381 | Peak |
| November 1929 | 230 | -40% |
| 1930 | 164 | -57% |
| 1931 | 77 | -80% |
| July 1932 | 41 | -89% |

## Causes

### The Debate

| Interpretation | Key Cause | Policy Implication |
|----------------|-----------|-------------------|
| Monetarist (Friedman-Schwartz) | Fed allowed money supply to collapse | Central banks must provide liquidity |
| Keynesian | Aggregate demand collapsed | Fiscal stimulus needed |
| Austrian | Prior credit expansion | Let correction happen |
| Debt-deflation (Fisher) | Debt burden rose as prices fell | Prevent deflation |

### Contributing Factors

| Factor | Mechanism |
|--------|-----------|
| 1920s speculation | Overvaluation, margin buying |
| Bank failures | 9,000 banks failed, deposits lost |
| Gold standard | Constrained monetary response |
| Tariffs (Smoot-Hawley) | Collapsed international trade |
| Wealth effect | Stock losses → reduced spending |

## The Banking Crisis

### Bank Failures by Year

| Year | Bank Failures | Deposits Lost |
|------|---------------|---------------|
| 1929 | 659 | $250 million |
| 1930 | 1,352 | $853 million |
| 1931 | 2,294 | $1.7 billion |
| 1932 | 1,456 | $706 million |
| 1933 | 4,004 | $3.6 billion |

### Why Banks Failed

| Vulnerability | Consequence |
|---------------|-------------|
| No deposit insurance | Runs rational |
| Fractional reserves | Couldn't meet withdrawals |
| Loan losses | Asset values collapsed |
| Contagion | One failure triggered others |

### The Friedman-Schwartz Thesis

| Argument | Evidence |
|----------|----------|
| Fed could have stopped it | Didn't act as lender of last resort |
| Money supply collapsed 30% | 1929-1933 |
| Turned recession into depression | Policy failure, not market failure |
| Lesson | Central banks must provide liquidity |

## Economic Impact

### United States

| Indicator | 1929 | 1933 | Change |
|-----------|------|------|--------|
| GDP | $104 billion | $57 billion | -45% |
| Unemployment | 3.2% | 24.9% | +21.7 points |
| Industrial production | 100 | 54 | -46% |
| Wholesale prices | 100 | 66 | -34% |

### Global Spread

| Country | Peak-to-Trough GDP Decline |
|---------|---------------------------|
| United States | -26.7% |
| Germany | -15.7% |
| France | -14.7% |
| United Kingdom | -5.1% |
| Canada | -29.0% |

### Social Consequences

| Impact | Manifestation |
|--------|---------------|
| Unemployment | Breadlines, Hoovervilles |
| Migration | Dust Bowl, Okies |
| Radicalization | Rise of extremism |
| Family stress | Delayed marriage, lower birth rates |

## Policy Responses

### Hoover Administration (1929-1933)

| Policy | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Voluntary coordination | Business agreements failed |
| RFC (1932) | Too little, too late |
| Smoot-Hawley tariff | Made things worse |
| Balanced budget | Pro-cyclical |

### Roosevelt and the New Deal (1933-1939)

| Phase | Measures |
|-------|----------|
| First 100 Days | Bank holiday, Emergency Banking Act, FDIC, CCC, AAA, NIRA |
| Second New Deal | Social Security, Wagner Act, WPA |
| Monetary | Left gold standard, dollar devalued |

### What Worked?

| Policy | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| Bank holiday | Stopped panic |
| FDIC | Prevented future runs |
| Leaving gold | Allowed monetary expansion |
| WPA/CCC | Direct employment |
| NIRA | Mixed (later struck down) |
| AAA | Agricultural prices rose |

## The Gold Standard Trap

### How Gold Constrained Policy

| Constraint | Consequence |
|------------|-------------|
| Fixed exchange rates | Couldn't devalue |
| Gold outflows | Required raising interest rates |
| Deflation spread | Transmitted across countries |
| Competitive devaluations | Race to leave gold |

### The Great Escape

| Country | Left Gold | Recovery Timing |
|---------|-----------|-----------------|
| UK | September 1931 | Early recovery |
| US | April 1933 | Recovery began |
| France | 1936 | Late recovery |
| Pattern | Earlier exit → faster recovery |

### Eichengreen's Thesis

| Argument | Implication |
|----------|-------------|
| Gold standard was "golden fetters" | Ideology prevented response |
| Countries that left recovered first | Policy regime mattered |
| International coordination failed | Every country for itself |

## Recovery

### What Ended the Depression?

| Theory | Mechanism |
|--------|-----------|
| World War II spending | Massive fiscal stimulus |
| Monetary expansion | After leaving gold |
| Confidence restoration | Bank reforms |
| Debt restructuring | Bankruptcies cleared balance sheets |

### Partial Recovery (1933-1937)

| Indicator | 1933 | 1937 | Improvement |
|-----------|------|------|-------------|
| GDP | $57 billion | $91 billion | +60% |
| Unemployment | 24.9% | 14.3% | -10.6 points |
| Industrial production | 54 | 103 | +91% |

### 1937 Recession

| Cause | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| Fed tightened | Raised reserve requirements |
| Fiscal contraction | Budget balancing |
| Unemployment rose | 14% → 19% |
| Lesson | Premature tightening dangerous |

## Institutional Legacy

### Financial Reform

| Institution | Function |
|-------------|----------|
| FDIC (1933) | Deposit insurance |
| SEC (1934) | Securities regulation |
| Glass-Steagall | Separated commercial/investment banking |
| Fed reform | More active lender of last resort |

### Welfare State

| Program | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| Social Security | Old-age insurance |
| Unemployment insurance | Automatic stabilizer |
| Minimum wage | Wage floor |
| Labor rights | Union protection |

### Macroeconomic Management

| Change | Manifestation |
|--------|---------------|
| [[Keynesian Economics]] | Counter-cyclical policy accepted |
| Employment as goal | Full Employment Act (1946) |
| Central bank mandate | Price stability + employment |
| International coordination | Bretton Woods system |

## Interpretations

### Monetarist

| Claim | Evidence |
|-------|----------|
| Fed's fault | Money supply data |
| Could have been stopped | Other central bank successes |
| Natural market correction | Became catastrophe through policy |

### Keynesian

| Claim | Evidence |
|-------|----------|
| Aggregate demand collapsed | Investment, consumption data |
| Fiscal stimulus helped | New Deal recovery |
| Markets can fail | Coordination problems |

### Austrian

| Claim | Evidence |
|-------|----------|
| 1920s credit expansion | Malinvestment |
| Bust was necessary correction | Cleansing |
| New Deal prolonged it | Prevented adjustment |

### Institutionalist

| Claim | Evidence |
|-------|----------|
| Institutions failed | Gold standard, no deposit insurance |
| Institutions fixed | FDIC, SEC, Fed reform |
| Path dependence | New Deal institutions persisted |

## The Deeper Point

The Great Depression showed that markets can collapse catastrophically—the question became what [[Institutions and Progress|institutions]] prevent or cause such failures. Before 1929, the dominant view was that markets self-correct: recessions were painful but brief adjustments. The Depression shattered this faith. What followed was a fundamental redesign of economic institutions:

- [[Central Banking|Central banks]] became lenders of last resort
- Deposit insurance ended bank runs
- Securities regulation reduced fraud and manipulation
- Automatic stabilizers smoothed downturns
- International monetary coordination replaced gold

The debate continues: Was the Depression caused by bad institutions (gold standard, no FDIC) or bad policy (Fed's failure to act)? Either way, the answer was institutional—building structures that would prevent catastrophic failure. The Depression's greatest legacy is the recognition that markets require institutional infrastructure: rules, safeguards, and backup systems that prevent self-reinforcing collapse. This insight informed the response to every subsequent crisis, including [[2008 Financial Crisis Deep Dive|2008]].
