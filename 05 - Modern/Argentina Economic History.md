# Argentina Economic History

From richest to chronic crisis. Argentina is the great puzzle—a rich country that became middle-income, showing that natural resources aren't enough without [[Institutions and Progress|institutional stability]].

## The Golden Age (1880-1930)

### The Miracle

| Indicator | Performance |
|-----------|-------------|
| GDP growth | 6% annually (1880-1914) |
| Per capita income | Near top 10 globally |
| Immigration | 6 million Europeans (1880-1930) |
| Rail network | 4th largest in world |
| Exports | Beef, wheat, wool to Europe |

### Why Argentina Was Rich

| Factor | Contribution |
|--------|--------------|
| Pampas | Best agricultural land in world |
| Refrigeration | Enabled beef exports (1876) |
| British capital | Railways, finance |
| Immigration | Labor supply, skills |
| Proximity to Europe | Atlantic trade |

### The Model

| Element | Function |
|---------|----------|
| Export agriculture | Beef, grain |
| Free trade | Open economy |
| Foreign investment | Infrastructure |
| Immigration | Population growth |
| Sound money | Convertibility, gold standard |

### Elite Structure

| Class | Position |
|-------|----------|
| Estancieros | Large landowners, political power |
| Oligarchy | 300 families controlled politics |
| Immigrants | Urban, working class, excluded |
| Radicales | Middle-class political challenge |

## Decline Begins (1930-1946)

### 1930 Coup

| Change | Consequence |
|--------|-------------|
| Military intervention | Pattern established |
| Oligarchic restoration | Blocked reform |

## Hyperinflation and Convertibility (1983-2001)

### Democracy Returns

| Challenge | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Debt burden | Renegotiation |

| Consequences | Savings wiped out |
| Political crisis | Alfonsín left early |
| Social unrest | Food riots |

### Convertibility (1991-2001)

| Feature | Design |
|---------|--------|

| Credibility | Foreign investment returned |

### Why It Failed

| Vulnerability | Consequence |
|---------------|-------------|

| Fiscal provinces | Ran deficits |
| Debt accumulation | Couldn't devalue to adjust |
| External shocks | Brazil devalued (1999), commodity prices fell |
| Recession | 1998-2001 |

## 2001 Crisis

## Kirchner Era (2003-2015)

### Recovery

| Factor | Contribution |
|--------|--------------|
| Devaluation | Exports competitive |

## Why Can't Argentina Stabilize?

### Structural Factors

|--------|-----------|
| Commodity dependence | Vulnerable to price swings |
| Fiscal federalism | Provinces spend, nation pays |
| Indexation culture | Wages, contracts indexed |
| Dollarization | Savings flee peso |
| Political economy | Redistribution wins elections |

### Institutional Weakness

| Gap | Consequence |
|-----|-------------|
| No independent central bank | Politicians control money |
| Weak judiciary | Contracts uncertain |
| Polarized politics | No sustained reform |
| Vested interests | Unions, provinces block change |

### Historical Path Dependence

| Legacy | Persistence |
|--------|-------------|
| Perónism | Redistribution expectation |
| ISI | Protected industries |
| Inflation memory | But also inflation habits |
| Distrust | Of institutions, currency, each other |

## The Puzzle

### Why Argentina Failed

| Theory | Argument |
|--------|----------|
| Institutions | Weak, unstable, extractive |
| Populism | Short-term politics defeats long-term policy |
| Commodity curse | Boom-bust, no diversification |
| Path dependence | Early choices locked in |
| External shocks | Unlucky timing repeatedly |

### Comparison to Australia

| Australia | Argentina |
|-----------|-----------|
| Similar resources | Both had land, commodities |
| British institutions | Spanish institutions |
| Federal stability | Federal dysfunction |
| Independent central bank | Politicized central bank |
| Outcome: Rich | Outcome: Middle-income |

## The Deeper Point

Argentina is the great puzzle—a country that *was* rich and became middle-income. In 1900, Argentina was wealthier per capita than France, Germany, or Italy. Today, it suffers chronic inflation, serial defaults, and political instability.

The [[Institutional Economics|institutional explanation]] is compelling: Argentina never built stable property rights, independent monetary institutions, or fiscal discipline. Each government redistributed to its coalition, borrowed to finance deficits, and left the mess to successors. The short-term political game dominated long-term institution-building.

But the deeper question is *why* Argentina couldn't build institutions when other countries did. Perhaps the very wealth that made Argentina rich—the pampas—also made institutions unnecessary. When land generates wealth without effort, why build the tax systems, education, and governance that resource-poor countries must develop? The [[Resource Curse]] hypothesis applies even to agricultural abundance.

Argentina's tragedy is a warning: natural wealth isn't enough. [[Institutions and Progress|Institutions]] determine whether resources become development or dysfunction. A century of evidence suggests Argentina's institutions channel ambition toward redistribution and capital flight rather than investment and production.
