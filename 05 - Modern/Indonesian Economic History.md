# Indonesian Economic History

From colonial extraction to Suharto's crony capitalism to democratic transition. Indonesia's trajectory—world's fourth-largest population, oil wealth, ethnic diversity—shows both the possibilities and pathologies of development. The 1997 crisis exposed institutional weaknesses that decades of growth had masked.

## The Deeper Point

Indonesia's trajectory illustrates how [[Institutions and Progress|institutional quality]] determines whether resources become blessings or curses. Dutch extraction created a colonial economy oriented toward commodity export. Suharto's New Order achieved development but through crony capitalism that ultimately collapsed. Democratic Indonesia has grown but struggles to escape the middle-income trap.

The 1997 crisis exposed the institutional weaknesses that oil money and growth had masked. When the crisis hit, the crony capitalist system couldn't adapt—connected borrowers were bailed out, ordinary Indonesians suffered, and the political system collapsed. The contrast with South Korea, which used the crisis to reform, is stark.

Today's Indonesia faces the classic [[Development Economics|development]] challenge: how to build the institutions—education, rule of law, competitive markets—that enable sustained growth. Resource wealth (palm oil, nickel, coal) provides revenue but also enables rent-seeking. The question is whether democratic Indonesia can build stronger institutions than Suharto's authoritarian development state—or whether weak institutions will trap the world's fourth-largest nation at middle income.
