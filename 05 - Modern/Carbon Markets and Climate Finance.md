# Carbon Markets and Climate Finance

Carbon markets attempt to channel entrepreneurial ambition toward decarbonization by putting a price on emissions. Cap-and-trade systems limit total emissions and let firms trade allowances; carbon taxes price emissions directly. The EU Emissions Trading System is the largest experiment; voluntary markets enable corporate net-zero claims; green finance directs capital toward climate solutions. Whether these market mechanisms can achieve the scale and speed of decarbonization required remains uncertain—they're institutional innovations in progress, with success very much undetermined.

## Overview

### The Theory

| Concept | Mechanism |
|---------|-----------|
| Carbon pricing | Make emissions costly |
| Internalize externality | Polluter pays |
| Efficiency | Find cheapest reductions |
| Innovation | Incentive for clean technology |
| See | [[Environmental Economics]] |

### Two Approaches

| Cap-and-Trade | Carbon Tax |
|---------------|------------|
| Set quantity (cap), price floats | Set price, quantity floats |
| Certainty about emissions | Certainty about cost |
| Trading creates market | Simple administration |
| Examples: EU ETS, California | Examples: British Columbia, Sweden |

## Carbon Pricing History

### Early Experiments

| Date | Development |
|------|-------------|
| 1990 | US SO2 cap-and-trade (acid rain)—success |
| 1997 | Kyoto Protocol—international framework |
| 2005 | EU ETS launched—first major carbon market |
| 2008-12 | Kyoto compliance period |
| 2015 | Paris Agreement—national pledges |

### The SO2 Success

| Element | Outcome |
|---------|---------|
| 1990 Clean Air Act | Cap on sulfur emissions |
| Trading | Firms trade allowances |
| Compliance | 100% achieved |
| Cost | Much lower than predicted |
| Emissions | Fell 90%+ |
| Lesson | Markets can work for pollution |

### Why Carbon Is Harder

| Issue | Challenge |
|-------|-----------|
| Global scale | Requires international coordination |
| More sources | Everyone emits, not just power plants |
| Longer timeframe | Decades, not years |
| Political economy | More interests affected |
| Carbon leakage | Production moves to unpriced jurisdictions |

---

## EU Emissions Trading System

### How It Works

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Cap | Total allowances decline over time |
| Allocation | Free + auctioned allowances |
| Trading | Firms buy/sell allowances |
| Compliance | Must surrender allowances for emissions |
| Coverage | Power, industry, aviation (~40% of EU emissions) |

### Phases

| Phase | Period | Character |
|-------|--------|-----------|
| I | 2005-07 | Pilot, overallocation, price crashed |
| II | 2008-12 | Kyoto period, recession crashed price |
| III | 2013-20 | Centralized, auctioning |
| IV | 2021-30 | Tighter caps, border adjustment |

### Price History

| Period | Price (€/ton) |
|--------|---------------|
| 2008-12 | €5-30, crashed to €5 |
| 2013-17 | €5-8 (low, weak incentive) |
| 2018-20 | €15-30 (reform effects) |
| 2021-23 | €50-100 (effective) |
| Current | €80-100 |

### Lessons from EU ETS

| Lesson | Implication |
|--------|-------------|
| Overallocation | Caps must be tight |
| Price volatility | Need price floor/ceiling |
| Free allocation | Reduces effectiveness |
| Political economy | Industry lobbying weakens |
| Persistence | Took 15+ years to work |

## The Deeper Point

Carbon markets are [[Institutions and Progress|institutional]] experiments in channeling [[Entrepreneurship|entrepreneurial]] energy toward decarbonization. The theory is elegant: price carbon, and innovation will find the cheapest path to reduction. The practice is messy: political lobbying weakens caps; free allocation protects incumbents; offsets enable dubious claims; developing countries resist constraints. The EU ETS took 15 years to produce meaningful prices—time the climate doesn't have. But the alternative—pure regulation—has its own problems: less efficient, more captured by industry, harder to scale. The deepest challenge is that carbon markets assume marginal incentives will drive transformational change, but climate requires systemic transformation—new infrastructure, different cities, changed consumption. [[Business Regulation|Regulatory]] mandates (phase-out dates, efficiency standards) may be necessary complements. Green finance faces its own institutional gaps: ESG ratings diverge wildly; greenwashing is endemic; fiduciary duty is undefined for climate risk. The question isn't whether markets can help with climate—they clearly can price emissions and direct capital. The question is whether they can do so fast enough, and whether the institutional infrastructure to make them work can be built in time. Carbon markets are another test of whether 21st-century problems can be solved with 20th-century institutional tools.
