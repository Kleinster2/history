# Japanese Economic Miracle

Japan's postwar economic miracle transformed a devastated nation into the world's second-largest economy in a single generation. From 1950 to 1990, Japan grew faster and longer than any major economy before it, pioneering the "developmental state" model that would inspire the Asian Tigers. The miracle combined American occupation reforms, state guidance, corporate organization, and social consensus into an unprecedented growth machine.

## The Deeper Point

Japan's miracle refuted the assumption that Western [[Institutions and Progress|institutions]] were prerequisite for industrial development. Lifetime employment, enterprise unions, keiretsu cross-shareholding, MITI's administrative guidance—all violated Anglo-American orthodoxy, all worked spectacularly for 40 years. The system was optimized for catch-up growth: patient capital enabled long-term investment, lifetime employment enabled firm-specific skill accumulation, administrative guidance enabled coordinated industrial upgrading. But the miracle's end (1990) revealed the model's fatal flaw: institutions optimized for imitation become traps when the frontier is reached and [[Innovation Economics|innovation]] requires the creative destruction that the system was explicitly designed to prevent. Cross-shareholding blocked hostile takeovers that would restructure failing firms; lifetime employment prevented labor reallocation; administrative guidance couldn't identify frontier technologies. Japan proves both halves of the institutional thesis: the right framework can produce extraordinary growth, and the wrong framework—even one that previously succeeded—can produce extraordinary stagnation.
