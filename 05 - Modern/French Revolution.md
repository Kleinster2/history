# French Revolution

The French Revolution (1789-1799) fundamentally transformed France and influenced the world through its ideas of liberty, equality, and popular sovereignty. Beyond politics, the Revolution had profound economic dimensions: fiscal crisis triggered it, economic reforms (abolishing feudalism, liberating trade) shaped it, and revolutionary and Napoleonic wars disrupted European economies. The Revolution marks the boundary between early modern and modern history.

### The Deeper Point

The French Revolution was an institutional earthquake: in a few years it abolished guilds, ended feudal dues, nationalized church property, established uniform commercial law, and created the metric system—destroying centuries of accumulated institutional friction in one burst. This is why [[Institutions and Progress|institutional economics]] matters: France's *Ancien Régime* wasn't poor because it lacked resources or talent, but because its institutions (guild monopolies, internal tariffs, noble exemptions from [[Taxation|tax]], venal offices) channeled ambition into rent-seeking rather than production. The Revolution proved that institutional change can be revolutionary rather than incremental—but also that destruction is easier than construction. Napoleon's Civil Code ultimately did more for French economic development than the Terror, because it provided the *stable* property rights and contractual framework that markets require.
