# Electricity and Power Systems

Electricity enabled mass production and modern life. Unlike steam power, which required factories to cluster around engines, electricity could be transmitted and subdivided—freeing industrial layout, enabling assembly lines, powering homes and cities. The electrification of America (1880s-1930s) was among the largest productivity gains in history. But electricity also created a new institutional form: the regulated utility. Too important to leave to unregulated markets, too capital-intensive for competition, electrical utilities became the template for natural monopoly regulation that shaped infrastructure industries for a century.

## Overview

### Why Electricity Transformed Everything

| Domain | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Factories | Flexible power, assembly line possible |
| Cities | Lighting, transit, elevators (skyscrapers) |
| Homes | Appliances, comfort, convenience |
| Communication | Radio, telephone, eventually internet |
| Computing | The foundation of digital revolution |

### The Numbers

| Metric | 1900 | 1930 | 2020 |
|--------|------|------|------|
| US homes electrified | 3% | 70% | 100% |
| Industrial power (electric) | 5% | 80% | 100% |
| Electricity share of energy | <1% | 10% | 20% |

### The War of Currents

| Argument | DC (Edison) | AC (Tesla/Westinghouse) |
|----------|-------------|-------------------------|
| Safety | Claimed safer | Actually comparable |
| Transmission | Short distance only | Long distance possible |
| Transformation | Cannot change voltage | Transformers enable voltage change |
| Outcome | AC won | DC lost (mostly) |

### Why AC Won

| Factor | Advantage |
|--------|-----------|
| Transformers | Step up for transmission, step down for use |
| Distance | Power plants could be far from load |
| Economics | Cheaper transmission infrastructure |
| Flexibility | Multiple voltages for different uses |

### Key Developments

| 1882 | Pearl Street Station (NYC)—first central power station |
| 1886 | Westinghouse AC system |
| 1891 | First long-distance AC transmission (Germany) |
| 1893 | Chicago World's Fair—AC demonstrated |
| 1895 | Niagara Falls plant—AC triumph |

## The Utility Model

### The Natural Monopoly Problem

| Factor | Implication |
|--------|-------------|
| Huge fixed costs | Power plants, transmission, distribution |
| Low marginal costs | Adding customers cheap |
| Economies of scale | Bigger is more efficient |
| Duplication waste | Multiple wires on street = inefficient |
| Conclusion | Competition doesn't work |

### Samuel Insull's Vision

| Innovation | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| Central station | Large, efficient power plants |
| Load factor | Diversity of customers smooths demand |
| Advertising | "Sell it cheap, sell it to many" |
| Holding companies | Financial structures for expansion |
| Collapse (1932) | Over-leveraged empire failed |

### The Regulatory Compact

| Utility Gets | Public Gets |
|--------------|-------------|
| Monopoly franchise | Universal service obligation |
| Guaranteed return on investment | Rate regulation |
| Protected from competition | Reliability standards |
| Cost recovery | Prudent investment only |

### Regulatory Institutions

| Agency | Jurisdiction |
|--------|--------------|
| State public utility commissions | Retail rates, most regulation |
| Federal Power Commission (1920) | Hydroelectric, interstate |
| FERC (1977) | Wholesale markets, transmission |
| NERC | Reliability standards |

## The Grid

### How It Works

| Component | Function |
|-----------|----------|
| Generation | Power plants produce electricity |
| Transmission | High voltage lines (>69kV) move power long distance |
| Distribution | Lower voltage lines deliver to customers |
| Load balancing | Supply must match demand instantly |
| Interconnection | Regional grids synchronized |

### US Grid Structure

| Grid | Coverage |
|------|----------|
| Eastern Interconnection | East of Rockies |
| Western Interconnection | West of Rockies |
| ERCOT | Texas (separate) |
| Synchronization | Each grid at 60 Hz, synchronized |
| Ties | Limited connections between grids |

### Reliability

| Requirement | Reason |
|-------------|--------|
| Real-time balance | No significant storage |
| Frequency control | 60 Hz must be maintained |
| Voltage support | Keep within tolerances |
| Blackout risk | Cascading failures possible |
| 2003 blackout | Showed grid vulnerability |

## The Deeper Point

Electricity shows how [[Institutions and Progress|institutional]] forms emerge to manage transformative technologies. The technology itself—generating, transmitting, and using electric power—was revolutionary. But exploiting it required solving the natural monopoly problem: electricity grids are natural monopolies, yet unregulated monopolies would overcharge and underserve. The regulated utility was the institutional solution: grant a franchise monopoly, impose service obligations, and regulate returns. This worked well enough to electrify America, achieving among history's largest productivity gains. But the model has drawbacks: cost-plus regulation encourages gold-plating; monopolies resist innovation; stranded cost debates paralyze reform. The deregulation experiments (California's disaster, Texas's freeze) show the fragility of market solutions for electricity's peculiarities (real-time balance, reliability externalities). The current challenge—decarbonization—requires massive infrastructure investment that neither markets nor traditional regulation handles well. [[Entrepreneurship|Entrepreneurial]] energy in electricity has different channels: Edison and Westinghouse were inventor-entrepreneurs; Insull was an organizational innovator; today's entrepreneurs work on solar costs, battery chemistry, and grid software. The sector demonstrates that infrastructure capitalism requires ongoing [[Business Regulation|institutional]] innovation—the regulatory compact that worked for the 20th century doesn't obviously work for the 21st.
