# Steel Industry

Steel was the backbone of industrial civilization—the material that built railways, bridges, skyscrapers, ships, and automobiles. From Bessemer's breakthrough in 1856 through Carnegie's domination to today's Chinese supremacy, steel has defined industrial power. Unlike textiles, steel required massive capital, sophisticated technology, and often state support—making it the quintessential heavy industry. The rise and fall of national steel industries tracks the shifting center of industrial gravity from Britain to America to Japan to Korea to China.

## The Deeper Point

Steel demonstrates how [[State Capacity|state capacity]] and industrial policy interact with [[Creative Destruction|creative destruction]] to determine national economic trajectories. Britain invented the industry but declined as rivals invested more aggressively; the US dominated through Carnegie's vertical integration and scale; Japan's MITI coordination produced world-class quality; Korea's POSCO proved developmental state planning could create globally competitive industry from scratch. The [[Varieties of Capitalism]] framework applies: LME (US) produced Nucor's minimill disruption from market competition; CME (Japan, Germany) produced quality-focused incremental innovation; developmental states (Korea, China) directed capital and technology toward strategic scale. China's 50% global share shows what happens when the state commits unlimited capital and tolerates massive overcapacity—world-beating scale that distorts global markets. The [[Antitrust History|antitrust]] dimension matters: US Steel's creation in 1901 was the monopoly that launched modern antitrust concern, while China's state-directed consolidation represents a different approach entirely. The industry's current challenge—decarbonization—tests whether institutions designed for expansion can manage contraction. Green steel requires massive capital investment to replace existing capacity, investment that markets alone won't provide and that states must somehow coordinate. Steel's future, like its past, will be shaped by institutional choices about state involvement, trade policy, and industrial strategy rather than by technology alone.
