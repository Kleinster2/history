# New Zealand Economic History

From Māori subsistence to British farm to neoliberal laboratory. New Zealand's transformation shows how a small, isolated economy can achieve prosperity through institutional adaptation—and how quickly institutional frameworks can change when crisis demands.

## The Deeper Point

New Zealand's 1984 reforms were among the most radical [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal]] experiments in the developed world. A small, isolated economy transformed in a few years from heavily protected and regulated to among the most open and market-oriented. The experiment provides evidence for both proponents and critics of market reform.

For proponents: New Zealand survived the shock, adjusted, and remains prosperous. Agriculture, stripped of all subsidies overnight, eventually thrived by competing globally. Inflation was tamed, fiscal balance restored, and the economy diversified.

For critics: inequality increased dramatically, wages stagnated, and public services deteriorated. The promise that deregulation would unleash productivity growth never materialized—New Zealand's productivity puzzle persists. And the reforms happened without democratic mandate or consultation.

The [[Institutions and Progress|institutional]] lesson is that reform is possible—even radical reform—but the distribution of costs and benefits depends on design. New Zealand chose shock therapy over gradualism, efficiency over equity, and markets over redistribution. Different choices would have produced different outcomes. The fact that reform happened doesn't validate the particular form it took.

New Zealand's geographic isolation makes it a natural experiment: a small, developed economy that must trade to survive but can't rely on regional integration. Every policy choice shows up clearly in a 5-million-person economy. The results—prosperity but persistent inequality, openness but productivity problems—suggest that market reforms are necessary but not sufficient for sustained development.
