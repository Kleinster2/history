# Antitrust History

Antitrust is capitalism's immune system—the institutional mechanism that prevents successful competitors from eliminating competition itself. From Standard Oil's dismemberment in 1911 to the tech antitrust battles of the 2020s, competition policy determines whether markets remain arenas of [[Creative Destruction|creative destruction]] or calcify into monopoly. The history of antitrust is the history of societies deciding when big is bad, what "competition" means, and whether government or markets should discipline business power.

## Overview

### The Core Tension

| Problem | Response |
|---------|----------|
| Success creates market power | Antitrust limits that power |
| Competition is efficient | But winners want to stop competing |
| Innovation requires scale | But monopoly stifles innovation |
| Consumers benefit from low prices | But also from choice and dynamism |

### Antitrust Timeline

| Era | Character |
|-----|-----------|
| 1890-1914 | Sherman Act, trust-busting |
| 1914-1930s | Clayton Act, FTC, more tools |
| 1940s-1970s | Structural, aggressive enforcement |
| 1980s-2000s | Chicago School, consumer welfare |
| 2010s+ | Tech platforms, antitrust revival |

### The Sherman Act (1890)

| Provision | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| Section 1 | Conspiracies in restraint of trade |
| Section 2 | Monopolization or attempt |

---

## The Trust-Busting Era (1900-1914)

### Roosevelt and Taft

| Administration | Approach |
|----------------|----------|
| Theodore Roosevelt | "Good trusts" vs. "bad trusts" |
| Cases | Northern Securities (1904), Standard Oil (1911) |

| Innovation | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| Specific prohibitions | Price discrimination, tying, exclusives |
| Merger review | Block anticompetitive combinations |
| Labor exemption | Unions not conspiracies |
| FTC | New enforcement agency |

---

## Structural Era (1940s-1970s)

### The Harvard School

| Principle | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| Structure-Conduct-Performance | Market structure determines behavior |
| Concentration bad | High concentration → high prices |
| Remedy | Structural breakups preferred |
| Skepticism of bigness | Big = bad, regardless of efficiency |

### Major Cases

| Case | Year | Outcome |
|------|------|---------|
| Alcoa | 1945 | Monopoly from size alone |
| United Shoe | 1953 | Leasing practices |
| AT&T consent decree | 1956 | Equipment separation |
| Brown Shoe | 1962 | Merger blocked at low concentration |

### Peak Enforcement

| Feature | Character |
|---------|-----------|
| Merger policy | Very strict |
| Conduct | Broad per se rules |
| IBM | Decade-long case (dropped 1982) |
| AT&T | Breakup (1984) |

---

## The Chicago Revolution (1980s-2000s)

### Chicago School Critique

| Argument | Implication |
|----------|-------------|
| Markets self-correct | Monopoly is temporary |
| Efficiency matters | Bigness can be efficient |
| Consumer welfare standard | Only prices and output matter |
| Courts fail | Judges can't manage markets |
| Error costs | False positives worse than false negatives |

### Key Figures

| Scholar | Contribution |
|---------|--------------|
| Robert Bork | *The Antitrust Paradox* (1978) |
| Richard Posner | Law and economics |
| Aaron Director | Chicago foundations |

### Policy Shift

| Before Chicago | After Chicago |
|----------------|---------------|
| Structure matters | Conduct matters |
| Per se rules | Rule of reason |
| Break up | Behavioral remedies |
| Skeptical of mergers | Permissive |
| Market definition broad | Market definition narrow |

### Major Cases

| Case | Outcome |
|------|---------|
| Matsushita (1986) | Predatory pricing nearly impossible |
| Kodak (1992) | Some conduct still matters |
| Microsoft (2001) | Monopolization found, no breakup |

---

## Tech and Antitrust Revival (2010s+)

### The New Concerns

| Platform | Concern |
|----------|---------|
| Google | Search monopoly, self-preferencing |
| Facebook/Meta | Social media dominance, acquisitions |
| Amazon | Retail power, marketplace control |
| Apple | App Store, ecosystem lock-in |

### Why Platforms Are Different

| Feature | Antitrust Challenge |
|---------|---------------------|
| Network effects | Winner-take-all dynamics |
| Multi-sided markets | Hard to define "consumers" |
| Data as asset | New forms of market power |
| Free products | Can't measure harm by price |
| Rapid change | Markets evolve faster than cases |

### Neo-Brandeisian Movement

| Principle | Argument |
|-----------|----------|
| Consumer welfare too narrow | Power, innovation, democracy matter |
| Structure matters again | Concentration is the problem |
| Hipster antitrust? | Critics' label |
| Policy | Block acquisitions, break up, regulate |

### Recent Cases

| Case | Status |
|------|--------|
| Google (2020) | DOJ suit, search monopoly |
| Facebook (2020) | FTC suit, Instagram/WhatsApp |
| Apple (2024) | DOJ suit, ecosystem |
| Epic v. Apple | App Store, partial victory |

| Geographic | Where can consumers turn? |
| Product | Substitutes? |
| Why it matters | Market share depends on definition |

### Merger Analysis

| Step | Question |
|------|----------|
| Market definition | What market is affected? |
| Concentration | HHI, market shares |
| Competitive effects | Will prices rise? |
| Entry | Can new firms enter? |
| Efficiencies | Cost savings? |
| Remedies | Divestitures? Conditions? |

### Conduct Analysis

| Conduct | Standard |
|---------|----------|
| Horizontal price fixing | Per se illegal |
| Vertical restraints | Rule of reason |
| Tying | Mixed |
| Predatory pricing | Very hard to prove |
| Refusal to deal | Rarely illegal |

## Debates

### What Harm Matters?

| View | Focus |
|------|-------|
| Consumer welfare | Prices, output |
| Total welfare | Include producer surplus |
| Political | Democracy, power |
| Innovation | Dynamic competition |

### Error Costs

| Error | Chicago View | Neo-Brandeisian View |
|-------|--------------|----------------------|
| False positive | Blocks efficient conduct | Rarely happens |
| False negative | Markets self-correct | Creates lasting harm |
| Preference | Under-enforcement | Enforcement |

### Remedies

| Remedy | Effectiveness |
|--------|---------------|
| Structural breakup | Permanent, but disruptive |
| Behavioral | Preserves scale, but hard to monitor |
| Fines | Deterrence, but cost of doing business |
| Consent decrees | Negotiated, but weak |

## The Deeper Point

Antitrust is the institutional mechanism that determines whether [[Creative Destruction|creative destruction]] is permitted to operate. Baumol's insight applies directly: [[Entrepreneurship|entrepreneurial]] ambition can flow toward building better products (productive) or toward monopolizing markets and eliminating competitors (unproductive). Without antitrust, successful competition destroys competition—the winner erects barriers, buys potential rivals, and channels its ambition into preserving market power rather than continuing to innovate. Standard Oil's dismemberment in 1911 demonstrated that the state could preserve competitive conditions; the Chicago School's ascent demonstrated that the state could also step back too far, allowing concentration to rise to levels that (critics argue) now threaten innovation and democracy. The tech antitrust debates of the 2020s are fundamentally about whether network-effects industries can be competitive at all, or whether they represent a new form of natural monopoly requiring either breakup or utility-style regulation. The deeper pattern: antitrust enforcement is pro-cyclical with political economy—rising when inequality is salient, retreating when business interests dominate. [[State Capacity|State capacity]] matters: antitrust requires sophisticated agencies with economic expertise and political insulation. The European/American divergence shows that [[Varieties of Capitalism|different capitalisms]] approach competition differently—the same firms are treated as innovative in the US and monopolistic in the EU, reflecting different institutional logics.
