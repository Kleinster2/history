# Asian Financial Crisis 1997

The emerging market crisis that revealed capital flow dangers. The Asian crisis showed how [[Institutions and Progress|institutions]] designed for one context (capital mobility) could devastate economies lacking supporting institutions (bank regulation, flexible rates).

## The Miracle Before the Fall

### Asian Tiger Growth (1960-1996)

| Country | Average Annual Growth |
|---------|----------------------|
| South Korea | 8.6% |
| Thailand | 7.5% |
| Indonesia | 6.0% |
| Malaysia | 6.8% |
| Philippines | 3.5% |

### Why "Miracle"?

| Achievement | Mechanism |
|-------------|-----------|
| Rapid industrialization | Export-oriented growth |
| Poverty reduction | Broad-based employment |
| Education | Human capital investment |
| Stability | Long political continuity |

## Build-Up to Crisis

### Capital Inflows

| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| High interest rates | Attracted foreign capital |
| Fixed exchange rates | Reduced perceived currency risk |
| Short-term borrowing | Cheaper than long-term |
| Dollar pegs | Implicit guarantee |

### Vulnerabilities

| Weakness | Manifestation |
|----------|---------------|
| Current account deficits | Thailand 8% of GDP |
| Short-term foreign debt | Often exceeded reserves |
| Bank lending booms | Real estate, speculation |
| Crony capitalism | Connected lending |
| Currency mismatch | Borrowed in dollars, earned in baht |

### Warning Signs Ignored

| Signal | Response |
|--------|----------|
| Property bubbles | "Different here" |
| Bad loans | Hidden, rolled over |
| Overvaluation | Defended with reserves |
| Mexico 1994 | "We're not Mexico" |

## The Crisis Unfolds

### Timeline

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| July 2, 1997 | Thailand floats baht, 15% drop |
| July-August | Contagion to Philippines, Malaysia |
| August | Indonesia widens band, then floats |
| October | Taiwan, Hong Kong attacked |
| November | Korea crisis begins |
| December | Korea IMF program |
| January 1998 | Suharto agrees to IMF terms |
| May 1998 | Suharto falls |

### Currency Collapses

| Currency | Pre-Crisis Rate | Worst Point | Decline |
|----------|-----------------|-------------|---------|
| Thai baht | 25/$ | 55/$ | -55% |
| Indonesian rupiah | 2,400/$ | 17,000/$ | -86% |
| Korean won | 900/$ | 1,700/$ | -47% |
| Malaysian ringgit | 2.5/$ | 4.5/$ | -45% |

## Mechanisms of Crisis

### The Doom Loop

| Stage | Process |
|-------|---------|
| 1 | Foreign investors flee |
| 2 | Currency falls |
| 3 | Foreign debt burden rises |
| 4 | Banks insolvent |
| 5 | Credit contracts |
| 6 | Economy shrinks |
| 7 | More investors flee |

### Bank Runs and Panic

| Dynamic | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| Liquidity crisis | Couldn't roll over short-term debt |
| Fire sales | Forced to sell at any price |
| Credit crunch | Banks stopped lending |
| Contagion | One country's crisis triggered others |

### Why Contagion?

| Channel | Mechanism |
|---------|-----------|
| Trade links | Export competition |
| Common creditors | Banks pulled out of region |
| Wake-up call | Reassessed all emerging markets |
| Herding | Funds followed each other out |

## Economic Impact

### GDP Collapse

| Country | 1998 GDP Growth |
|---------|-----------------|
| Indonesia | -13.1% |
| Thailand | -10.5% |
| Malaysia | -7.4% |
| Korea | -5.5% |
| Philippines | -0.6% |

### Social Costs

| Impact | Manifestation |
|--------|---------------|
| Poverty | Millions fell back below poverty line |
| Unemployment | Tripled in Korea |
| Education | Dropout rates rose |
| Health | Malnutrition increased |
| Political instability | Suharto fell, Thai PM changed |

## IMF Response

### The Rescue Packages

| Country | Amount | Date |
|---------|--------|------|
| Thailand | $17 billion | August 1997 |
| Indonesia | $43 billion | October 1997 |
| Korea | $57 billion | December 1997 |

### IMF Conditions

| Requirement | Rationale |
|-------------|-----------|
| Fiscal austerity | Restore confidence |
| High interest rates | Defend currency |
| Bank closures | Remove insolvent banks |
| Structural reforms | Corporate governance, transparency |
| Trade liberalization | Open markets |

### The Controversy

| Critique | IMF Defense |
|----------|-------------|
| Austerity worsened recession | Standard medicine for balance of payments |
| High rates killed economy | Had to stop capital flight |
| Conditions too intrusive | Addressed root causes |
| Moral hazard | Punished borrowers and lenders |

## Recovery Paths

### Divergent Responses

| Country | Strategy | Outcome |
|---------|----------|---------|
| Korea | IMF program, reforms | Fast recovery |
| Malaysia | Capital controls, rejected IMF | Recovered anyway |
| Thailand | IMF program | Slow recovery |
| Indonesia | IMF program, political collapse | Prolonged crisis |

### Malaysia's Alternative

| Policy | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Fixed exchange rate (3.8/1) | Stabilized expectations |
| Capital controls | Stopped outflows |
| Lower interest rates | Supported growth |
| Bank restructuring | Nationalized, recapitalized |
| Outcome | Recovered without IMF austerity |

### Lessons from Divergence

| Observation | Interpretation |
|-------------|----------------|
| Malaysia did okay | Maybe capital controls work |
| Korea recovered fast | Reforms mattered |
| Indonesia worst | Political collapse compounded |
| No one-size-fits-all | Context matters |

## Lessons Learned

### For Countries

| Lesson | Application |
|--------|-------------|
| Watch short-term debt | Maturity mismatch dangerous |
| Build reserves | Self-insurance |
| Flexible exchange rates | Absorb shocks |
| Bank regulation | Supervise lending |
| Capital flow management | Maybe controls have a place |

### For International System

| Lesson | Change |
|--------|--------|
| Lender of last resort needed | But conditionality controversial |
| Early warning | IMF surveillance |
| Orderly debt restructuring | Collective action clauses |
| Private sector involvement | Bail-in, not just bailout |

### Reserve Accumulation

| Country | Reserves 1997 | Reserves 2007 |
|---------|---------------|---------------|
| Korea | $34 billion | $262 billion |
| Thailand | $31 billion | $87 billion |
| Malaysia | $27 billion | $101 billion |
| China | $140 billion | $1.5 trillion |

## Institutional Implications

### What Was Missing

| Gap | Consequence |
|-----|-------------|
| Bank supervision | Crony lending hidden |
| Corporate governance | Connected borrowing |
| Transparency | True liabilities unknown |
| Flexible rates | Couldn't adjust smoothly |
| Crisis management | No orderly workout |

### What Changed

| Reform | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| Bank restructuring | Cleaned up balance sheets |
| Corporate reform | Governance, disclosure |
| Float currencies | Shock absorber |
| Reserve building | Self-insurance |
| Regional cooperation | Chiang Mai Initiative |

## The Deeper Point

The Asian crisis showed how [[Institutions and Progress|institutions]] designed for one context could devastate economies lacking supporting institutions. Capital account liberalization worked well in countries with strong bank supervision, transparent corporate governance, and flexible exchange rates. When applied to countries without these supports, it created catastrophic vulnerabilities.

The pattern reveals a general principle: institutional reforms work as packages. Capital mobility without bank supervision is dangerous. Fixed exchange rates without reserves are fragile. Rapid lending without governance creates crony capitalism. The "Washington Consensus" assumed institutions could be transplanted one at a time; the Asian crisis showed they come as interconnected systems.

The aftermath also revealed institutional capacity for learning. Countries built massive reserves. Regional cooperation emerged. Bank supervision improved. The crisis became a lesson incorporated into institutional memory—applied when [[2008 Financial Crisis Deep Dive|2008]] arrived. Institutions failed in 1997, but the failure itself became a source of institutional learning.
