# Cold War

The Cold War (1947-1991)—the ideological, political, and economic struggle between the United States and Soviet Union—shaped the post-WWII world without direct superpower military conflict. The competition had profound economic dimensions: two rival systems (capitalism vs. communism) contested which could deliver prosperity. The Cold War drove military spending, development aid, and ultimately the Soviet system's collapse partly from economic exhaustion.

### The Deeper Point

The Cold War was the 20th century's great natural experiment in institutional economics. Two systems—one based on private property, prices, and profit; the other on state ownership, planning, and quotas—competed for 45 years across similar populations. The result was decisive: market economies outperformed command economies in consumer goods, innovation, and adaptability (though not in heavy industry mobilization or equality). The [[Soviet Economy]]'s failure wasn't effort—it invested enormously—but *information*: without prices, planners couldn't know what to produce, in what quantities, at what cost. This is [[Innovation Economics|Hayek's knowledge problem]] made continental-scale. The Cold War's economic lesson is the vault's thesis stated as competition: [[Institutions and Progress|institutions that channel ambition into production]] outperform those that channel it into plan-fulfillment.
