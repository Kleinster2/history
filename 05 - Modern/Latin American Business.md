# Latin American Business

Latin American business is dominated by *grupos*—large, diversified, family-controlled conglomerates that span multiple industries and maintain close ties to government. From Mexico's Grupo Carso to Brazil's Votorantim to Chile's Luksic, these groups are the institutional form that business takes in a region where weak property rights, volatile macroeconomics, and relationship-based politics make family control and diversification rational strategies. The grupos are not a failure to develop "modern" corporations; they're an adaptation to Latin American institutions.

## Historical Roots

### Colonial Business

| Institution | Legacy |
|-------------|--------|
| Haciendas | Large landholding families |
| Mining | Extraction-oriented |
| Merchant houses | Spanish trade monopoly |
| Social hierarchy | Business = elite |

### Independence Era

| Change | Effect |

## The Grupo Structure

### Why Diversification?

| Reason | Logic |
|--------|-------|
| Weak institutions | Can't trust markets to provide |
| Internal capital markets | Allocate within group |
| Risk spreading | Macroeconomic volatility |
| Regulatory arbitrage | Navigate across sectors |
| Relationship leverage | Use political ties broadly |

### Why Family Control?

| Reason | Logic |
|--------|-------|
| Trust | In low-trust environments |
| Agency costs | Monitor family, not strangers |
| Long-term | Patient capital |
| Network | Extended family as partners |
| Legacy | Multi-generational thinking |

### Pyramidal Structures

| Mechanism | Function |
|-----------|----------|
| Holding companies | Family controls apex |
| Cross-shareholding | Companies own each other |
| Control exceeds ownership | 20% ownership → 100% control |
| Minority extraction | Family benefits, outsiders lose |

## The Deeper Point

Latin American business groups are the institutional response to an environment where [[Institutions and Progress|formal institutions]] are weak—weak [[Property Rights|property rights]], unpredictable regulation, volatile macroeconomics, and relationship-based politics. In such environments, family control solves the trust problem that in other contexts is solved by courts and contracts; diversification provides the internal capital markets that in other contexts are provided by banks and equity markets; political connections provide the security that in other contexts comes from rule of law. The grupos are not failures to achieve "modern" corporate forms—they're rational adaptations that outperform arm's-length structures in Latin American institutional conditions. But they're also part of why those conditions persist: grupos benefit from weak minority protection (easier family control), from regulatory complexity (relationships matter more), and from political instability (connections valuable). This is [[Institutions and Progress|institutional]] path dependence in action: colonial extraction created inequality; inequality created concentrated business ownership; concentrated ownership created political power to maintain weak institutions; weak institutions justified concentrated ownership. The [[Latin American Development|development puzzle]]—why Latin America remains middle-income despite 200 years of independence—is partly a business organization puzzle: grupos are productive within their institutional environment, but that environment itself limits [[Creative Destruction|creative destruction]] and broad-based entrepreneurship. The comparison to [[Korean Chaebol|Korea]] is instructive: similar family conglomerates, but embedded in a developmental state that forced export competition and technological upgrading. Without such pressure, grupos can profit from protection rather than productivity.
