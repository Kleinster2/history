# Mexico Economic History

From revolution to NAFTA. Mexico's proximity to the US shapes everything—the question is whether integration enables development or creates dependency.

| Fiscal expansion | López Portillo spending |
| Inflation | Rising |

## The Debt Crisis and Opening (1982-1994)

## Contemporary Challenges

### AMLO Era (2018-2024)

| Policy | Direction |
|--------|-----------|
| Austerity | Cut government spending |
| Energy nationalism | Favor Pemex, CFE |
| Social programs | Direct transfers |
| USMCA | Renegotiated NAFTA |
| Nearshoring | Opportunity from US-China tensions |

| US-China tensions | Supply chain relocation |
| USMCA | Preferential access |
| Labor costs | Competitive |
| Proximity | Logistics advantage |
| Challenge | Infrastructure, energy, rule of law |

## Mexico-US Integration

### Trade Dependence

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|

| Remittances | $50+ billion annually |
| Migration | 11 million Mexicans in US |
| Investment | US dominant source |

### The Integration Question

| View | Argument |
|------|----------|
| Positive | Access to largest market, technology transfer |
| Negative | Dependency, wage competition, agriculture destroyed |
| Mixed | Benefits but unevenly distributed |

### North-South Divide

| Region | Economy |
|--------|---------|
| Northern border | Maquiladoras, integration |
| Central | Mexico City, services |
| South | Agriculture, poverty, left behind |
| Gap | Widening |

## The Deeper Point

Mexico's proximity to the US shapes everything—the question is whether integration enables development or creates dependency. NAFTA transformed Mexico into an export platform, but the benefits concentrated in the north while the south lagged. Manufacturing jobs grew, but wages stayed low. Trade tripled, but productivity stagnated.

The [[Institutional Economics|institutional question]] is whether integration with a much larger economy can drive development or creates structural subordination. East Asian countries integrated with the global economy while building domestic capacity. Mexico integrated but saw less domestic upgrading—the maquiladora model relies on cheap labor rather than building technological capability.

The contrast with China is instructive: China used access to Western markets to build industrial capacity, then moved up the value chain. Mexico provided labor arbitrage but less capability building. The difference may be institutional: China's state directed industrial policy, while Mexico's neoliberal model left upgrading to market forces that didn't materialize.

Nearshoring offers a new opportunity—US-China tensions could redirect investment to Mexico. But capturing this opportunity requires the [[State Capacity|institutional capacity]] (infrastructure, energy, rule of law) that has been Mexico's persistent weakness. Proximity is an advantage, but only if institutions can channel it into development rather than just assembly.
