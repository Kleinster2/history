# Brazil Economic History

From coffee kingdom to emerging giant. Brazil's cycles of boom and crisis reveal how commodity dependence and weak [[Institutions and Progress|institutions]] create volatility—the same resources that enabled growth also prevented diversification.

## Colonial Economy (1500-1822)

### Export Cycles

| Era | Commodity | Region |
|-----|-----------|--------|
| 1550-1650 | Sugar | Northeast (Bahia, Pernambuco) |

## Real Plan and Stabilization (1994-2002)

### The Real Plan

### Institutional Weakness

| Property rights | Land conflict, uncertainty |
| Contract enforcement | Slow courts |
| Tax system | Complex, distorting |

| Infrastructure | Underfunded |

### Inequality

|---------|--------|
| Gini coefficient | Among world's highest |
| Race | Black-white gaps persist |
| Region | Northeast vs. Southeast |
| Education | Steep returns gradient |

## The Deeper Point

Brazil's cycles of boom and crisis reveal how [[Resource Curse|commodity dependence]] and weak [[Institutions and Progress|institutions]] create volatility. Each commodity cycle—sugar, gold, coffee, oil—brought wealth but not sustained development. Why?

- **Commodity booms discourage diversification**: When coffee or iron ore is profitable, why invest in harder manufactures?
- **Windfall revenues weaken fiscal discipline**: Easy money funds patronage, not investment.
- **Inequality compounds**: Export wealth concentrates in few hands, limiting domestic market.
- **Institutions remain weak**: No pressure to reform when commodities pay.

The contrast with [[Korean Chaebol|Korea]] or [[Japanese Economic Miracle|Japan]] is instructive: those countries had few natural resources and *had* to build institutions and industries. Brazil could always fall back on the next commodity. The 2000s boom and 2010s bust repeated the pattern yet again.

Brazil's challenge is institutional: building the property rights, education systems, and state capacity that would enable sustained, diversified growth. The resources are there—the question is whether institutions can channel commodity wealth into development rather than consumption and corruption.
