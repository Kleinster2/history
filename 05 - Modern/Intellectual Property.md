# Intellectual Property

Intellectual property—patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets—is the legal infrastructure that makes innovation a business model. Without IP, inventors and creators cannot capture the returns from their work; with too much IP, follow-on innovation is blocked and access is restricted. The history of IP is the history of societies trying to balance incentives for creation against the benefits of diffusion. Get the balance wrong, and you either get no innovation (too little protection) or innovation captured by incumbents (too much).

## Overview

### The Core Problem

| Without IP | With IP |
|------------|---------|
| Ideas freely copied | Temporary monopoly |
| No incentive to invent | Returns to invention |
| Fast diffusion | Slower diffusion |
| Competition | Market power |
| Who invests in R&D? | R&D becomes profitable |

### Types of IP

| Type | Protects | Duration |
|------|----------|----------|
| Patents | Inventions | 20 years |
| Copyrights | Creative works | Life + 70 years |
| Trademarks | Brand identity | Indefinite (renewable) |
| Trade secrets | Confidential information | Indefinite (if secret) |

## Business Strategy and IP

### IP as Competitive Advantage

| Strategy | Mechanism |
|----------|-----------|
| Patent portfolio | Exclude competitors |
| Cross-licensing | Trade access |
| Defensive patents | Deter lawsuits |
| Offensive patents | Sue competitors |
| Standards essential | Required for industry standard |

### Industry Variation

| Industry | IP Role |
|----------|---------|
| Pharmaceuticals | Critical—patent = product |
| Software | Contentious, many patents |
| Electronics | Patent thickets |
| Biotech | Complex, gene patents |
| Fashion | Minimal (no protection for designs) |

### Patent Thickets

| Problem | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| Overlapping patents | Blocking positions |
| Fragmentation | Need many licenses |
| Holdup | Last holder extracts rent |
| Solution? | Patent pools, standards bodies |

### Patent Trolls

| Feature | Character |
|---------|-----------|
| Non-practicing entities | Don't make products |
| Business model | Acquire patents, sue |
| Targets | Operating companies |
| Defense | Expensive litigation |
| Debate | Rent-seeking or liquidity-providing? |

## Copyright in the Digital Age

### Copyright Expansion

| Development | Change |
|-------------|--------|
| Term extension | Life + 70 (from 14!) |
| Berne Convention | International harmonization |
| DMCA (1998) | Anti-circumvention |
| Digital rights | DRM protection |

### Digital Challenges

## The Deeper Point

Intellectual property is the institutional mechanism that makes [[Innovation Economics|innovation]] a business model—but it's a double-edged sword. The basic logic is Schumpeterian: temporary monopoly (the patent) rewards the innovator, incentivizing R&D investment that wouldn't otherwise happen. Without IP, imitation is free, and no one invests in being imitated. But IP can also block [[Creative Destruction|creative destruction]]: incumbent firms use patent portfolios to exclude competitors, thickets require costly navigation, and trolls extract rents without producing anything. The pharmaceutical industry shows both sides: patents enable the multi-billion-dollar investments required for drug development, but they also create the access crisis that leaves life-saving medicines unaffordable for billions. The historical pattern matters: today's industrial powers built their industries by copying (the US pirated British textile technology; Japan reverse-engineered everything), then strengthened IP once they had technology worth protecting. TRIPS imposes on developing countries the IP standards that developed countries would never have accepted at similar stages. [[Varieties of Capitalism]] shapes IP too: the American system (strong, litigious, patent-centric) differs from European approaches (weaker software patents, more compulsory licensing). The deeper insight: IP is not "property" in the natural sense—it's a policy instrument, a deliberate institutional choice about how to channel [[Entrepreneurship|entrepreneurial]] ambition. Too weak, and ambition flows away from innovation; too strong, and it flows into rent-seeking, litigation, and blocking. The optimal IP regime depends on industry, development stage, and institutional context—there is no universal answer.
