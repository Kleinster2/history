# Rwandan Economic Development

Post-genocide transformation. Rwanda tests whether authoritarian development can work—rapid growth but at what political cost, and is it sustainable?

| Trade | Congo minerals through Rwanda |
| Conflict | Ongoing eastern Congo war |

### Strategic Interests

| Interest | Manifestation |
|----------|---------------|
| Security | Buffer against threats |
| Economic | Resource access |
| Population | Rwandophone communities |
| Deniability | Maintains |

## Sustainability Questions

### Can It Last?

| Challenge | Concern |
|-----------|---------|
| Succession | No plan, Kagame aging |
| Aid dependency | What if donors defect? |
| Land | Densest African country |
| Employment | Youth jobs |
| Political steam | Repression can't last forever? |

### Structural Limits

| Constraint | Reality |
|------------|---------|
| Size | 13 million, small market |
| Landlocked | High transport costs |
| Resources | Few natural resources |
| Agriculture | Limited land |
| Manufacturing | Barely exists |

### Comparison to Singapore

| Similarity | Difference |
|------------|------------|
| Authoritarian development | Singapore had port |
| Technocratic | Singapore had education base |
| Clean government | Singapore had location |
| One leader | Lee Kuan Yew had succession |

## The Deeper Point

Rwanda tests whether authoritarian development can work. The evidence is genuinely mixed:

**For the model:**
- Growth has been real and sustained
- Poverty has fallen substantially
- Services are delivered effectively
- Corruption is controlled
- Infrastructure is improving

**Against the model:**
- Political repression is severe
- No succession planning
- Aid dependence is high
- Congo involvement is problematic
- Sustainability is questionable

The [[Institutional Economics|institutional question]] is whether Rwanda is building durable institutions or Kagame-dependent systems. Lee Kuan Yew built institutions in Singapore that outlasted him. Is Kagame doing the same, or will Rwanda's progress depend on his personal rule?

The developmental state model—strong government driving growth while limiting political freedom—has worked in East Asia. Rwanda is Africa's test case. But Asian developmental states eventually democratized (Korea, Taiwan) or face pressure (Singapore, China). Rwanda has no democratic transition in sight.

The genocide's shadow makes this especially fraught. Kagame's legitimacy rests on ending the killing and preventing recurrence. The ban on ethnic discussion is meant to prevent future violence. But suppressed identities don't disappear—they wait. Rwanda's development is real, but so are the risks.
