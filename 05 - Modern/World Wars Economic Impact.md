# World Wars Economic Impact

The two World Wars (1914-1918, 1939-1945) were the most economically destructive events in human history—mobilizing entire economies for total war, destroying capital and lives, reshaping global economic power, and creating the institutions of the post-1945 order. The wars ended European dominance, elevated the United States, devastated the Soviet Union and Germany, and demonstrated that industrial economies could be bent entirely to military purposes.
