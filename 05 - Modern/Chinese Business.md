# Chinese Business

China created a new organizational form: party-state capitalism. Neither purely state-owned nor purely private, Chinese business operates in the space the Communist Party permits—which can expand or contract overnight. The result is a system that produced the fastest industrialization in history, the world's largest tech platforms, and companies that can scale at terrifying speed—but where every firm exists at the pleasure of the state. This is not Anglo-American capitalism with Chinese characteristics; it's a genuinely different system, and understanding it is essential to understanding 21st-century business.

## Overview

### The Chinese Business Ecosystem

| Type | Examples | Character |
|------|----------|-----------|
| State-owned enterprises (SOEs) | Sinopec, State Grid, ICBC | Party-controlled, strategic sectors |
| National champions | Huawei, CRRC, AVIC | Nominally private or mixed, state-supported |
| Private giants | Alibaba, Tencent, BYD | Market-driven, but party-supervised |
| Entrepreneurs | Millions of SMEs | Highly competitive, precarious |
| Township-village enterprises | 1980s-90s phenomenon | Local government as entrepreneur |

### Scale

| Unicorns | 300+ |
| Tech platform users | 1+ billion each (Alibaba, Tencent, ByteDance) |
| SOE assets | $30+ trillion |
| Manufacturing | 30% of global output |

## Phase 4: The Crackdown (2020-present)

### What Happened

| Event | Date | Target |
|-------|------|--------|
| Ant Group IPO blocked | Nov 2020 | Fintech, Jack Ma |
| Antitrust fine (Alibaba) | Apr 2021 | Platform monopoly |

### Why the Party Cracked Down

| Concern | Reasoning |
|---------|-----------|
| Political power | Tech billionaires too independent |
| Data control | Platforms know too much |

| Message | Party supreme, always |

### The New Rules

| Principle | Implication |
|-----------|-------------|
| "Capital as a tool, not master" | Profit-seeking must serve state goals |
| "Common prosperity" | Redistribution, donation pressure |
| Data sovereignty | Government access mandatory |
| "Hard tech" prioritized | Semiconductors, AI, not consumer apps |
| National champions | Must serve national security |
